"Growing up from a kid to adulthood, I’m sure all of us has our own favorite hobbies, interests, or dirty little secret. Not many people like to admit it but it’s part of our society and how we live in. For a show about the otaku culture and exploring the lifestyle of the nerd norm, Wotake ni Koi wa Muzukashii really set the bar high. Welcome to a world where office romance, otakuism, and gaming culture become an experience you won’t forget.The English translation title is “It’s Difficult to Love an Otaku” and “Love is Hard of Otaku”. Literally, those words mushed up together already...feels like the show is a big joke or satire. While the show seems like it’s taking a risk at mixing a variety of questionable gimmicks together, I can say safely that there’s no need to worry. As a fan of the manga, I was thrilled to learn that Noitamina was chosen to air this show. It seems fitting for such an anime based on their history of lineups. What’s more is that this show also portrays a more realistic slice of life story that you don’t see too often these days. To me, this was a God-sent gift for Spring 2018.I’m not going to lie. Watching this anime reminds me of being a kid despite the show being targeted at an older audience. The goofy style of the storytelling along with the colorful character cast brings in a very playful atmosphere. Even as the show takes place in an office life environment, it’s hard to ignore the character chemistry between the main cast. From the start, we got two childhood friends named Narumi Momose and Hirotaka Nifuji. The two have known each other for awhile but are almost like complete polar opposites. Narumi is a bubbly outgoing girl with an interest in fujoshi and otome games. On the other hand, Nifuji is an otaku with an avid interest in video games and doesn’t actually seem to care what other thinks of him. Despite their different personalities, it’s undeniable that the two has chemistry both during and off work. The other two lovebirds in the show consists of Hanako Koanagi and Tarou Kabakura. They are dating as a couple and while the two constantly bickers at every chance they get, the two genuinely seems to love each other. Now, you’re probably thinking…is this going to be a show filled with drama and misunderstandings? Absolutely not. While the show contains office romance, it’s hardly a story that focuses on that exclusively. Instead, this anime stands out as a way of exploring the everyday adventures of these characters.One of the primary factors that makes this show appealing is the small character cast. It capitalizes on giving every character a chance to shine without leaving another in the dust. The couple pair of Narumi and Nifuji is infectiously entertaining to watch. Their character chemistry is shown through their interests that somehow intersects with their daily lives. At the office, the two maintains a professional relationship although they still act casually towards each other. The show explores their relationship development as they understand each other more in their adult lives. This even includes going on dates to the movies or amusement park. While the show adapts their relationship more as a ship tease, I think it’s safe that fans accepts them as a couple. Hanako and Tarou are dating already so the show doesn’t hide the fact that they care for each other. It’s mostly lighthearted romance that relies more on realism to do the storytelling. Office romance isn’t easy to adapt but this anime does that without ever being distracting. Characters act the way humans do while drawing connection to their otaku interests. Each of the main characters has their own interest. (otome games, gamer, cosplaying, bishoujo) As a central theme of the show, it establishes their interest through dialogues, interactions, and references. The show often throws in jokes with characters’ small talk and arguing to sell its comedy. It’s damn entertaining as every character gets their moment of fame. It masterfully matches the pacing of the dialogues that feels very real. The impression those moments bring is an accurate depiction of how co-workers behave. Whenever this nerdy group goes out for a drink, they act like casual adults enjoying life. It brings in the sensation of a rom-com between working adults that leaves me satisfied. Oh and before I forget to mention, give the manga a try too. The anime actually expands on some background content but the manga also feels like its own little world.To be honest, A-1 Pictures is the last studio I would imagine adapting this show. However, the production quality itself is vibrant with colorful character designs. The characters looks distinct between one another with their different hair colors and facial expressions. Character reactions also sell a good deal of the comedy especially whenever Narumi reacts in exaggerated manners. As an anime that focuses on otaku, do expect video game references to be made such as the Nintendo Switch and Monster Hunter. There’s even one episode where the characters are adapted into an RPG setting with very gimmicky video game themes.No fan service? No problem. You have the character dialogues doing the talking and most of it delivers humor in the most harmless ways. Yet at the same time, it’s able to create quality entertainment thanks to the talents of the voice cast. Narumi and Hanako in particular are able to bring out the best out of characters through that with their human personalities. The theme songs are also quite creative with their choreography. Namely, the OP song “Fiction” by Sumika is adorably cute with the body language. Every character in the theme songs stands out with their coordinated movements.With 11 episodes, it felt just enough for this anime to do what it’s intended and that’s to sell its ideas to the audience. It succeeds that thanks to its creative circle of characters and their interests. Otakuism is not something that’s accepted easily as a positive culture norm. In fact, it’s often looked down upon in our society. However, this show presented that in a positive way. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the show is recommendable to just about anyone. A show like this deserves more attention, seriously.",growing kid adulthood im sure u favorite hobby interest dirty little secret many people like admit part society live show otaku culture exploring lifestyle nerd norm wotake ni koi wa muzukashii really set bar high welcome world office romance otakuism gaming culture become experience wont forgetthe english translation title difficult love otaku love hard otaku literally word mushed together alreadyfeels like show big joke satire show seems like taking risk mixing variety questionable gimmick together say safely there need worry fan manga thrilled learn noitamina chosen air show seems fitting anime based history lineup whats show also portrays realistic slice life story dont see often day godsent gift spring im going lie watching anime reminds kid despite show targeted older audience goofy style storytelling along colorful character cast brings playful atmosphere even show take place office life environment hard ignore character chemistry main cast start got two childhood friend named narumi momose hirotaka nifuji two known awhile almost like complete polar opposite narumi bubbly outgoing girl interest fujoshi otome game hand nifuji otaku avid interest video game doesnt actually seem care think despite different personality undeniable two chemistry work two lovebird show consists hanako koanagi tarou kabakura dating couple two constantly bicker every chance get two genuinely seems love youre probably thinkingis going show filled drama misunderstanding absolutely show contains office romance hardly story focus exclusively instead anime stand way exploring everyday adventure charactersone primary factor make show appealing small character cast capitalizes giving every character chance shine without leaving another dust couple pair narumi nifuji infectiously entertaining watch character chemistry shown interest somehow intersects daily life office two maintains professional relationship although still act casually towards show explores relationship development understand adult life even includes going date movie amusement park show adapts relationship ship tease think safe fan accepts couple hanako tarou dating already show doesnt hide fact care mostly lighthearted romance relies realism storytelling office romance isnt easy adapt anime without ever distracting character act way human drawing connection otaku interest main character interest otome game gamer cosplaying bishoujo central theme show establishes interest dialogue interaction reference show often throw joke character small talk arguing sell comedy damn entertaining every character get moment fame masterfully match pacing dialogue feel real impression moment bring accurate depiction coworkers behave whenever nerdy group go drink act like casual adult enjoying life brings sensation romcom working adult leaf satisfied oh forget mention give manga try anime actually expands background content manga also feel like little worldto honest picture last studio would imagine adapting show however production quality vibrant colorful character design character look distinct one another different hair color facial expression character reaction also sell good deal comedy especially whenever narumi reacts exaggerated manner anime focus otaku expect video game reference made nintendo switch monster hunter there even one episode character adapted rpg setting gimmicky video game themesno fan service problem character dialogue talking delivers humor harmless way yet time able create quality entertainment thanks talent voice cast narumi hanako particular able bring best character human personality theme song also quite creative choreography namely op song fiction sumika adorably cute body language every character theme song stand coordinated movementswith episode felt enough anime intended thats sell idea audience succeeds thanks creative circle character interest otakuism something thats accepted easily positive culture norm fact often looked upon society however show presented positive way say without shadow doubt show recommendable anyone show like deserves attention seriously,positive,0.14862058080808074,0.51834859006734
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi for short) is a romance comedy which characters are Otakus (Anime or Game Otakus). It is set in an office setting, featuring 4 main characters (2 couples) that are dating each other. Here in there, you would see direct references to manga, anime, games, and the likes. However, this anime fails to deliver well in both comedy and romance. I think it is important for you to treat this more as a slice of life show featuring otaku couples, as to not give any unmet expectations.The romance in this anime is more of just a setting as it is...hardly explored. It will only occasionally throw in some romantic moments. Meanwhile, the jokes in this anime are rarely funny. I feel like the biggest problem to the comedy is the awful timing. It is really slow at delivering punchlines, making it unfunny at most times. To make it worse, there are sometimes short explanations by the game-sounding-narrator, which further slows down the pace.The characters here are not really outstanding. There's no traits or moments that I feel really stand out from them. Also, even though the couples' relationships might change a little, the characters themselves hardly changes.The background music is one problem I have with this anime. Maybe it's just not my taste, but although there are some good tracks, there are a lot of weird tracks that are just slapped unto an unfitting scene (honestly, I don't think those tracks could fit anywhere).Overall, I think this anime fails to deliver a good romcom. There is only a little romance development and jokes fall flat. This is an anime for watching the daily lives of otaku couples. And that's it, since the only thing this anime got going for it is its relatability for people familiar with the otaku culture.",wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii wotakoi short romance comedy character otakus anime game otakus set office setting featuring main character couple dating would see direct reference manga anime game like however anime fails deliver well comedy romance think important treat slice life show featuring otaku couple give unmet expectationsthe romance anime setting ishardly explored occasionally throw romantic moment meanwhile joke anime rarely funny feel like biggest problem comedy awful timing really slow delivering punchlines making unfunny time make worse sometimes short explanation gamesoundingnarrator slows pacethe character really outstanding there trait moment feel really stand also even though couple relationship might change little character hardly changesthe background music one problem anime maybe taste although good track lot weird track slapped unto unfitting scene honestly dont think track could fit anywhereoverall think anime fails deliver good romcom little romance development joke fall flat anime watching daily life otaku couple thats since thing anime got going relatability people familiar otaku culture,negative,-0.010714285714285735,0.5035714285714286
"I picked up Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii along with 3D Kanojo together back when the show first aired and expected both to be about the same, I gave the former an 8 and the latter a 7 originally if my memory doesn't fail me, and from then on even though both featured otaku (now it's obvious that 3D Kanojo only has one while Wotakoi has it's entire casts as the same but I picked it up together for the same reason) it became clear as day which was fresh garbage and which was the anime that made me dance. Looking at the rating I...think you know what show turned out to be the one that made me dance, yes. This is my review of Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii, ikuze!!!Let's start with some backstory. My last seasonal romance watch was in Summer of 2017, almost exactly three seasons ago, which is shocking because if you know me, I love romance and always strive to watch it in some way or the other but in terms of seasonals I felt tired and stopped focusing on the genre. To reasons obvious to romance fans I felt Spring would be the best season for a romance fan to return to the seasonal genre and found a lot of romance anime to watch, but none, absolutely none made me fall over them as much as I fell over Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii. Not because it's cute, but because it's unique, it's fun, and of course, it's got everything else going for it.I mean, look at it's competition this season (or even the last), what romance anime did we have? Tada-kun started strong but suffered with it's cliche problem shortly after, FranXX continues to be complete garbage in the romance category (and dare I say it every other category), the anime I formerly mentioned, 3D Kanojo almost immediately disappointed me with it's second episode, Grancrest had the same FranXX situation, while Beatless could be considered one slot better than the two mentioned. Leaving us with two romance anime this season that continued to be adored by me, Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii and Akkun To Kanojo. The latter was and still is an enjoyable show but being a short, it can't compare to Wotakoi in the same breath. Why? Read on!First off, it's a fantastic slice of life anime. Wotakoi is how you make a Slice of Life Romance work and I can't find any other examples that bettered it till Winter 2017 (when I first started seasonals) and overall I'm sure it'll rank up in my top 5. Yet again you ask why? Because it knows how to captivate it's watchers with warmth. This brings us to the question, why do we watch romance anime? Many would say that it's because it brings them warmth, and surprise, surprise, Wotakoi gives you that. A cute, warm and fuzzy slice of life anime you can cosy up to whether you're single or with your partner. Even though it's centered on Otakus, it's biggest feature is that there's something for everyone.Everyone will find something in the anime worth relating to and laughing at, and I'm just talking about the normies here, if you're a mild anime watcher or a hardcore one, both parties will find lots and lots to laugh at and references to gloss over with this anime. Be it a Dragon Quest reference, a Final Fantasy reference, a Saekano reference, etc etc. There's lots to list and I don't have enough time to list them all for we must move on to the next best part. The soundtrack. I don't think I need to tell you how popular the Opening is especially with it's dance and there's been countless videos on YouTube (some of which were taken down because Sony Music) showing viewers how the dance is done or how they reacted to this marvelous choreography. And that's not to mention the ED as well. Fantastic, cosy and just a joy to watch, it's an excellent example of a testament to the anime.And we've barely scratched the surface. What else makes the anime so fun? The biggest reason why? THE CHARACTERS! I haven't seen such vibrant AND relatable characters in an anime in a very long time and this was just fabulous. I mean, it makes me wanna write on every character. First off, we didn't get one pairup, we got TWO. Then the interactions, motivations, situations, all made for a really cute yet not over the top anime. It didn't overstep its bounds yet created an environment that only Wotakoi could create and excel in. This isn't a Utopia, this is real life, and the real life says Wotakoi is excellent. Speaking of real life, the wonderful staff who worked on this anime. Having renowned VAs like Sawashiro Miyuki and the legendary Sugita Tomokazu himself, this anime wasn't at all short of talent, and the others too did brilliantly. I never for once felt like the voice actors did a bad job, or that the directing or scripting was bad in any way.I might be sounding like I'm fanboying like crazy but let's just say Wotakoi IS that kind of show. It makes you warm and you're left beaming with happiness. Definitely something I'd call a feel-good show. Oh and, another reason why the anime is so amazing? It's got adults. Not high school kids as the main characters and that gives a LOT of room for different scenarios and even though our lovely cast might seem childish, in the first place, being an otaku is a throwback to childhood anyway. And second, we don't have any blushing game of random meetups and random kisses and random blushes and random etc like most high school anime (I already triggered the FranXX fanboys, don't want another group to come after me so I won't give examples now) because from the very first episode itself, everyone is dating. Yes. You read that right. They're dating from the first episode itself and they're adults and they're Otakus. Reasons enough for why it's so fantastic?Still not convinced? How about I tell you that in spite of having such a unique setup, it handles it excellently? Convinced? I sure do hope you are, because I still have more to say. I haven't even gone to the characters in detail yet! Hirotaka might seem like your dense that you see in most high school romance but NO. Do not underestimate him because he is sharp. I mean, the ending of episode 1 changed my view of him from the get go. Surprised? I was too! He continued to be brilliant like the rest of the cast. Narumi on the other hand is fortunately not a flat female character (I just love making that pun) as we see in some romance anime and much like Hirotaka, is just a joy to watch. She's cute, relatable, and is a perfect matchup for Hirotaka. Then we got the polar opposites, Hana-chan and Gintoki- I mean Bakaku- I mean Kabakura. Both were the most loveable lovebirds and sworn enemies, which was a sharp contrast to Hirotaka and Narumi and offered an excellent balance to the aforementioned pair. Though MAL marked them as Supporting Characters they're very much main characters as well since they're a main focus of the anime too! And that's not to mention the other supporting cast too, they're cute too and the biggest part is that even though they're a supporting cast, the brief moments they feature in were all relatable and enjoyable in their own regard and this was me trying my hardest to describe how lovable the cast is, I can't find the words to describe what I feel to the exact point but this should serve as a somewhat great substitute.STILL NOT CONVINCED? Then I can bring up the last of my cards, the artstyle. Many scorned and scoffed at the name of the studio when they first saw it's synopsis since it was made by A-1 Pictures. A studio that is designed for freelancers. What many realised later was that fortunately this was one of those “once in a blue baboon” situations where they turned out to be good, and I'm talking from the perspective of people who don't like A-1 but are objective critics. Me? Well, much like the other fans, I just enjoyed this. I have liked A-1’s many other works before in particular the Working! series and this just adds on to the fun.Coming back to the topic, it's artstyle was unique, vibrant, cheerful and not to mention adorable. There was just that some thing about it that made it such a joy to look at, whether you're watching it in 1080p, 720p, a CR free subscriber, or the 144p master race (is the show even available in this resolution? Maybe in YouTube). Needless to say it's artstyle is YET another plus point the anime had.It's very very tough to find negatives in this anime and the ones I found were that perhaps it's comedy didn't hit me every single time, though it did usually, I perhaps laughed at least once every episode and just longed for the next week’s episode to come out already and when it did, oh the joy I had.Overall, I don't think I need to point this out, but Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii is a romance anime that you definitely must watch if you're a fan of the genre or are looking for that fun Slice of Life anime to entertain and cosy up to. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this is my pick for Anime of the Year or to the extreme minimum, Romance/SoL of the Year. Romance? Yes. Otaku stuff? Yes, but that isn't too deep for someone to get bored with. End product? Something great that anyone and everyone can watch and enjoy! Yes. Even normies :PYou and I might not see eye to eye on the anime, but I'm sure you'll leave the anime with a smile, that is, if you love watching fun shows. Much like with everyone, you'll definitely find out that you struck a chord with a lot of the things in the anime. I mean, we're all Otakus aren't we?P.S: That last episode man. Incorporated everything that was great in the previous episodes and brought out the best from them to make for a fantastic end to a fantastic anime. If I were to describe Wotakoi in one word, it would ironically be that it's inclusive despite it's otaku centered focus.

"I’m honestly enjoying this anime so much, I look forward to the next episode every week.‘Love is hard for otaku’ to me, is a simple, funny and cute series with some references here and there, displaying the struggles and benefits of relationships between otaku, whether it’s just a friendly relationship or something more.The main characters all have their own characteristics and interests and lets be real, Hirotaka is hella cute I am shaking. Anyways! The relationships between the mc’s are developing as they get to know each other more and more and I am truly enjoying that journey, especially the little fights between Hanako and...Tarou.If you’re looking for something laid back yet cute and funny (and at times relatable), then I’d really recommend watching this. This is definitely my favourite out of the new anime airing this season.ps: I rated this with a 10 because I mainly rate anime based on how much I enjoy watching it so there's that!",im honestly enjoying anime much look forward next episode every weeklove hard otaku simple funny cute series reference displaying struggle benefit relationship otaku whether friendly relationship something morethe main character characteristic interest let real hirotaka hella cute shaking anyways relationship mc developing get know truly enjoying journey especially little fight hanako andtarouif youre looking something laid back yet cute funny time relatable id really recommend watching definitely favourite new anime airing seasonps rated mainly rate anime based much enjoy watching there,positive,0.1868801652892562,0.5403040141676505
"I'm surprised there aren't more people disappointed by this show. And while I am in no way someone who thinks that a faithful adaptation is required to make a good show (see: maid dragon), I think this anime really misses the mark.Starting with the basics, the animation is distractingly bad. This show definitely probably wouldn't require the large animation budget a lot of other shows need (except possibly some of the in game shots later), they definitely cut it back to the bare minimum: lots of still reaction shots, background art that seems disconnected from the foreground characters, and oh my god the faces....The faces seem like they were outsourced to a country where people's eyes wander around their face more than the plot in a bad fanfic.Jokes aside, the story and characters are where this anime loses any hope of redemption. The manga isn't funny or sweet purely through the ""nerd-culture"" content of its jokes, but because the character interaction and great pacing make you feel connected to it. This is a story about people looking to be accepted and wanting to belong, and reading the manga provides a unique feeling of belonging along with them. In stark contrast, this anime feels amazingly routine: uninspired direction causes the character interactions and jokes to fall flat and overall the immersion is totally lost.I cannot enumerate my disappointment in this show; I was really looking forward to it. There's so much missed opportunity for something amazing, but in the end, this story feels like just one out of a thousand generic anime romcoms. If you're looking for something like this show, Net-juu no Susume's anime walks all over this.",im surprised arent people disappointed show way someone think faithful adaptation required make good show see maid dragon think anime really miss markstarting basic animation distractingly bad show definitely probably wouldnt require large animation budget lot show need except possibly game shot later definitely cut back bare minimum lot still reaction shot background art seems disconnected foreground character oh god facesthe face seem like outsourced country people eye wander around face plot bad fanficjokes aside story character anime loses hope redemption manga isnt funny sweet purely nerdculture content joke character interaction great pacing make feel connected story people looking accepted wanting belong reading manga provides unique feeling belonging along stark contrast anime feel amazingly routine uninspired direction cause character interaction joke fall flat overall immersion totally losti enumerate disappointment show really looking forward there much missed opportunity something amazing end story feel like one thousand generic anime romcoms youre looking something like show netjuu susumes anime walk,positive,0.021889400921659,0.4810291858678955
"Who had enough of looking for a fulfilling romance in anime? Who got tired of the school-setting romance with dense characters that don't acknowledge their feelings until the last minute of the anime and they don't even hug or share a kiss? I don't know about you, but I have had enough!I tried a lot of romance anime in search of one that has the characters confess in the beginning and then the remaining of the series is them developing their relationship. But I was always disappointed. That is until I came across Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii.In the beginning, I tried watching the first...episode just to reconcile my hopeless relationship with romance animes. I went in with low expectations but that first episode threw me off guard!A confession in the first episode! I hope I wasn't dreaming! I replayed those two minutes until I believed my eyes, and my heart felt, for the first time in a very long while, full.I grew accustomed to getting disappointed in things that start off too good, so I went to the second episode reluctantly. It just got better.The anime revolves around two relationships. We get glances at how two 'otaku' couples live their everyday life at work, how they get through their days, how they support each other, and most importantly, we see glances of their love for each other and it's the cutest thing I have witnessed in a while. It has got a light-hearted comedy to complement everything and it works so well with the setting.This is a very wholesome anime. It doesn't have the forced drama, the unnecessary love triangle, the frustrating misunderstandings that could have been solved with talking, the teen angst. It is a pure romance comedy to lighten your mood and make you feel good after a shitty day. It is a win to the romance genre.",enough looking fulfilling romance anime got tired schoolsetting romance dense character dont acknowledge feeling last minute anime dont even hug share kiss dont know enoughi tried lot romance anime search one character confess beginning remaining series developing relationship always disappointed came across wotaku ni koi wa muzukashiiin beginning tried watching firstepisode reconcile hopeless relationship romance anime went low expectation first episode threw guarda confession first episode hope wasnt dreaming replayed two minute believed eye heart felt first time long fulli grew accustomed getting disappointed thing start good went second episode reluctantly got betterthe anime revolves around two relationship get glance two otaku couple live everyday life work get day support importantly see glance love cutest thing witnessed got lighthearted comedy complement everything work well settingthis wholesome anime doesnt forced drama unnecessary love triangle frustrating misunderstanding could solved talking teen angst pure romance comedy lighten mood make feel good shitty day win romance genre,positive,0.06044372294372294,0.4944444444444444
"Are u sick of all those high school setting romance show? Did u just finish ur job feeling tired trying to find some refreshment? Look no further as Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi) has got u covered. This is a very laid back show, if youre already have enough of the action shows this season provides with us, heres one that ill highly recommend for anyone who is up for their time.Wotakoi is a very well done rom-com series set in modern day Japan, covering our fellow otaku MCs, and otaku side characters. As aforementioned, our MCs are otakus, they like anime,...just like we all do. The story starts of with our female MC, Momose getting (almost) late for her new job, whilst being scared that her identity as an otaku will be found out by her new coworker. While being shown around the new environment of the office, she found herself coincidentally bumping into her old friend, Hirotaka, our male MC. At first the characters might turn u off as they seem very dull, but youll soon realize that they are just normal, very normal to a point that its like real life, a slice of life indeed. Its fun to watch as the characters start unveiling their little bits in life, how the progressed through their 'hardships' and stuff, the show is very engaging, and occasionally throwing references here and there, which ultimately leads into a far more enjoyable experience.Artstyle of Wotakoi is not impressive, but still very clean, polished, its smooth for ur eyes, I doubt anyone will complain about how it looks. I mean, as bad as how sometimes A-1 screw themselves over very badly, this here isnt the case. OST wise, the OP and ED is something ill never skip, they are just too good for not listening/watching. The songs are very good, but mostly the animation in the OP, absolutely fantastic. Its one of those very creative OPs youll ever bump into every now and then, like how the characters rotate with the camera angles, those transitions are just seamless, cocaine for ur eyes. Soundtracks in the anime itself thou doesnt have much of an impression left in me, either I was paying enough attention because of how well the anime is, or they were just there to compliment the show, nothing that memorable, but nothing to complain as well. Overall a very good and clean presentation.Now before I conclude, I rate the shows I watch MOSTLY by enjoyment. If a show is enjoyable, ill give it 8 and above, and thats probably why u might see that I have quite a high mean score for the animes Ive rated. As a 10/10 that Ive given, this is one of the shows that I think will undoubtedly be enjoyable for all, a very simple story, very likable characters and catchy OP/ED, all adds up to a great show overall. This is one of the shows that ill anticipate for every week, like how when youre 6 and eagerly waiting for the ice cream truck to come by every weekend. Even if rom-com isnt your taste, by all means give it a try, maybe youll poke into a region youve never experienced before too.",u sick high school setting romance show u finish ur job feeling tired trying find refreshment look wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii wotakoi got u covered laid back show youre already enough action show season provides u here one ill highly recommend anyone timewotakoi well done romcom series set modern day japan covering fellow otaku mc otaku side character aforementioned mc otakus like animejust like story start female mc momose getting almost late new job whilst scared identity otaku found new coworker shown around new environment office found coincidentally bumping old friend hirotaka male mc first character might turn u seem dull youll soon realize normal normal point like real life slice life indeed fun watch character start unveiling little bit life progressed hardship stuff show engaging occasionally throwing reference ultimately lead far enjoyable experienceartstyle wotakoi impressive still clean polished smooth ur eye doubt anyone complain look mean bad sometimes screw badly isnt case ost wise op ed something ill never skip good listeningwatching song good mostly animation op absolutely fantastic one creative ops youll ever bump every like character rotate camera angle transition seamless cocaine ur eye soundtrack anime thou doesnt much impression left either paying enough attention well anime compliment show nothing memorable nothing complain well overall good clean presentationnow conclude rate show watch mostly enjoyment show enjoyable ill give thats probably u might see quite high mean score anime ive rated ive given one show think undoubtedly enjoyable simple story likable character catchy oped add great show overall one show ill anticipate every week like youre eagerly waiting ice cream truck come every weekend even romcom isnt taste mean give try maybe youll poke region youve never experienced,positive,0.10542018827733113,0.5471231017659589
"Looking for a true romance, one with suspense, fluff, and drama? Then I will make this incredibly clear that this anime is not for you! I feel like I have to make this clear because I went into this anime based on description, genre, and rating expecting a romance and it really did not deliver.It has a lot of good qualities however. Anime and game lovers will find themselves identifying with the characters, and you’ll find yourself laughing at the exaggerated, but still relatable content. The art is also really cute, all the characters are distinct and different despite all being categorized as otaku’s....You get a peek into the lives of otaku’s of all different types, cosplay, crossplay, manga, videogames, anime, bl, etc. The main fandoms are all represented at least briefly. In its purest form, this anime is just about balancing otaku life with work life, that’s it.Still don’t believe me this isn’t a romance? Then I will spoil (but not really) the romance involved in this anime. For starters, the couple gets together by the end of episode one and it’s treated more like a joke. There is only one kiss scene the entire anime and all it is, is a peck (and it’s not even at the end of the series that this happens, so yea...no kiss at the end either) and again, it’s treated more like a joke. There’s really no development shown in the relationship, no misunderstands, or ups and downs. It’s more like two coworkers who share similar interests that happen to be a couple.I will confess that my score may be on the lower end than what this anime deserves. It’s actually a pretty good light-hearted, comedy. The art is cute, the characters are distinct and fun, and I admittedly got some laughs out of it, but I didn’t get what I wanted out of it and thus ended up rather disappointed.",looking true romance one suspense fluff drama make incredibly clear anime feel like make clear went anime based description genre rating expecting romance really deliverit lot good quality however anime game lover find identifying character youll find laughing exaggerated still relatable content art also really cute character distinct different despite categorized otakusyou get peek life otakus different type cosplay crossplay manga videogames anime bl etc main fandom represented least briefly purest form anime balancing otaku life work life thats itstill dont believe isnt romance spoil really romance involved anime starter couple get together end episode one treated like joke one kiss scene entire anime peck even end series happens yeano kiss end either treated like joke there really development shown relationship misunderstands ups down like two coworkers share similar interest happen couplei confess score may lower end anime deserves actually pretty good lighthearted comedy art cute character distinct fun admittedly got laugh didnt get wanted thus ended rather disappointed,positive,0.10967078189300408,0.48693415637860077
"Part of becoming an adult is finding hobbies that enrich our life and fill the time after exhausting days at work. Wotaku centers around 4 main characters who are obssessed with hobbies society frowns upon, some of whom have little to no social skills at all. Momose, the main lead, is obssessed with manga, especially Yaoi, something she's had to hide from all her previous boyfriends and friends. The other 3 aren't much different: Hanako is also into yaoi and cosplay, her boyfriend Kabakura obssesses over yuri and gaming, and Nifuji games almost to the expense of all else. Momose and Nifuji are childhood friends,...and he comes to an idea: they won't have to hide they're both otakus if they date.The art and character models are stock standard for modern anime, and the soundtrack is sufficient but nothing special. There's promise in a story of adult couples who pursue their own hobbies, finding their own group that values what they do. Let's ignore Momose and Hanako's love of fetishized yaoi, or Kabukara's hyper-infantilized yuri, which is opening a can of worms. The major flaw is the characters are engaging as soggy noodles in a watered down broth. The female leads have their boy's love extend into their real life partners, getting excited by any close interactions between the two. They debate in a single scene which one is the top and which is the bottom. The character dynamics revolve around their eccentric hobbies, but we never get more than a superficial glance at those hobbies.But the biggest flaw is the characters seem to not care for each other. Nifuji and Momose's relationship never extends past childhood friends, even after they start dating. She's not particularly attracted to him, and he makes it clear he'd be into a girl with larger breasts. Their relationship and interactions barely progress or regress. It feels like one of convenience and never develops from that. We never really dive into their actual interests, besides passing references and some stock standard online gameplay.Hanako and Kabukara constantly fight when others are around, even if their interactions are much more lukewarm when they're alone together. Hanako's hobbies are probably the most engaging: she's a well-known cosplayer, and diving into the process she designs and creates the costumes could be an excellent story. At least they seem to care for each other, and spend some enjoyable moments together.The entire character dynamic is ""are the straights ok"" the anime. With a stronger cast, a deeper dive into their interests, or a stronger plot, Wotaku could be engaging with an adult cast so desperately needed in romance anime. Instead, we get something that anyone but a hardcore otaku could really enjoy. Wotaku pales in comparison to other stories revolving around otaku like ""Princess Jellyfish"". The dive into online gaming is superficial unlike ""Recovery of an MMO Junkie"". The obsession with yaoi never extends to what we see in ""Kiss Him, Not Me"". It's not particularly bad but it's uninspired at best.",part becoming adult finding hobby enrich life fill time exhausting day work wotaku center around main character obssessed hobby society frown upon little social skill momose main lead obssessed manga especially yaoi something shes hide previous boyfriend friend arent much different hanako also yaoi cosplay boyfriend kabakura obssesses yuri gaming nifuji game almost expense else momose nifuji childhood friendsand come idea wont hide theyre otakus datethe art character model stock standard modern anime soundtrack sufficient nothing special there promise story adult couple pursue hobby finding group value let ignore momose hanakos love fetishized yaoi kabukaras hyperinfantilized yuri opening worm major flaw character engaging soggy noodle watered broth female lead boy love extend real life partner getting excited close interaction two debate single scene one top bottom character dynamic revolve around eccentric hobby never get superficial glance hobbiesbut biggest flaw character seem care nifuji momos relationship never extends past childhood friend even start dating shes particularly attracted make clear hed girl larger breast relationship interaction barely progress regress feel like one convenience never develops never really dive actual interest besides passing reference stock standard online gameplayhanako kabukara constantly fight others around even interaction much lukewarm theyre alone together hanakos hobby probably engaging shes wellknown cosplayer diving process design creates costume could excellent story least seem care spend enjoyable moment togetherthe entire character dynamic straight ok anime stronger cast deeper dive interest stronger plot wotaku could engaging adult cast desperately needed romance anime instead get something anyone hardcore otaku could really enjoy wotaku pale comparison story revolving around otaku like princess jellyfish dive online gaming superficial unlike recovery mmo junkie obsession yaoi never extends see kiss particularly bad uninspired best,positive,0.09702605570530098,0.42938454627133865
"What makes a good romcom anime?CharactersComedyNarrativeRelationships...DramaRomanceTheses are the things that usually make a romcom anime better not always good though. In the Spring 18 anime season there were two romcom that were strangely competing with each other. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku. Both of these show uses all of these elements that I just listed to make theses respective shows better but yet only one of them was good though.3D Kanojo Real Girl is a badly written romcom where only it had characters would talk over with each other without letting the other person finish but at various times the show hardly feels like a romcom as the show feels like more like a shitty slice of life anime set in high school. Not to mention the portrayal of Otaku culture as well the characterization and relationships were handled very poorly to a point where point where you just want to headbang a table.Thankfully its competitor WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku did not suffer from any of the problems that caused 3D Kanojo Real Girl to become such a horrendous romcom anime and as a result WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku became the best romcom of 2018. Not the best anime of 2018 but still a pretty great one.So what made this romcom so great you may ask?You gonna to find out soon enough.Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku and with that said and done let's get started.Story.The story follows a female officer worker Narumi who secretly hides her Fujoshi lifestyle from her co-workers. One day at work she is reunited with her gaming geek childhood Hirotaka after discovering that they work at the same company. After some drinking sessions outside of work they start to date each other but will it end up being a perfect relationship for theses two or will they fall apart.I really liked the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.For starters the show does a great at establishing its characters right from the first episode.  Unlike 3D Kanojo Real Girl where that show establishes the two main characters in a contrived and silly way Wotakoi decides to establish its main cast in a more mature where in the very first scene of the show where Narumi begins chatting kindly to Hirotaka. Unlike 3D Kanojo where by now both leads would talk over each other and random crap we actually to hear Narumi inner thoughts were we find out this is all a front to keep her secret from being exposed. Hirotaka end ups only partially revealing her secret but it quickly hard cuts to them drinking together. Not only does the show do a great job at presenting its actions that they were both otaku's but it manages to respect the tone of the office setting. The thing that sold me in this show is how the how portrays its romance because you see in real life there’s always a time and place where you can date as the two love birds in the show actually don’t date with each other until a day of work is over. Meaning when Hirotaka and Naruni are not working they are dating.Like with any good romcom the show uses it comedy and romance elements right allowing us to really relate to every comedic and romance conversation that's goes along.The show also a great job at portraying the Otaku culture where it showcases the highs and lows being an Otaku as an adult age. Not to mention the show goes a great job with it's references to video games and anime like Monster Hunter, Mario Kart,  JoJo etcThe one thing that this show over most romcom that are coming out in recently is how the show doesn't take place at high school. Don't get me wrong I like my fair share of anime that were set in high school but in recent memory the high school setting itself was getting too abused to a point where some shows that would have been better if the shows were not in high school.  I know this doesn’t really make a romcom show but for this case it does because we get to see a romance that is in a more mature setting that it has its own rules to follow.Overall the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great.9/10Characters.The characters in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku pretty good for the most part.Our female romcom lead Narumi is a pretty good character. Despite trying to hide her Otaku interests from her workmates she’s actually a nice and passion girl who loves Otaku hobbies. However I have one sight problem with her and that she can a hypocritical at times where there was a piece of dialogue where Hirotaka asks Narumi why she hasn't tried dating someone who understands Otaku, she replies that only another Otaku would understand and Otaku are gross, so she won't do it. Am sorry but why would you deny a man who also an Otaku. If anything I thought date him because you both love the Otaku culture. Thankfully she becomes a better character later where she accepts dating with Hirotaka a man who is an Otaku but at there were times she can be bit cringe-worthy. Minus her slight cringly attitude at times I liked Narumi for the most part.Hirotaka is probably the best character in the series. Unlike Narumi he doesn’t even bother hiding that being a Otaku as he is seen doing Otaku things in the open and he’s not a shamed of it.The character chemistry for Narumi and Hirotaka is nothing but brilliant as they talk they time to understand each by doing all of these Otaku act’s outside of work life.Hanako and Tarou are two characters that I liked. Unlike Hirotaka and Narumi they relationship is a rocky one as they constantly like having a go with each other like enemies most of the time. While they are not as memorable as the main two couple I thought they were still enjoyable characters.Overall the characters were pretty good and enjoyable.8/10Visuals.For a romcom anime this shows looks great. A1 Pictures did a awesome at capturing the setting of the series with it's nice use of business colour pallets that blends in well the shows great character and appealing designs. This is by far the best looking anime I have seen from A1 Pictures and it's not even a shounen series while most of those shows would have decent to average visuals at best. Honestly if A1 Pictures had more anime in this style for they action series then those shows would have been least Bones/J.C Staff tier instead of looking at they just came out from McDonalds unfinished filled with art failures.The animation is pretty nice and smooth for what it is so that’s that.8/10Sound.The soundtrack in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great overall as it does a great at capturing the tone and setting of the series.Both the opening and ending themes of the show are very good and memorable.The voice acting is top notch overall. All the Seyiuss did a great job with the roles that were given.9/10Final Thoughts.Overall this show was just great romcom to start to finish.The story was great, the romance was excellent, and comedy was great and well executed. The characters are great where they all likeable in they own ways. The visuals were surprisingly great and appealing and the soundtrack was beautiful.Despite being only 11 episodes this show was still able to be a better and well thought out romcom anime then the likes of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san and 3D Kanojo Real Girl. It may not be my favourite romcom series ever but I was still one hell of a good one.If you’re looking for a great romcom anime that explores the Otaku culture in a realistic way that I recommend WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.Final Score 8.5/10",make good romcom animecharacterscomedynarrativerelationshipsdramaromancetheses thing usually make romcom anime better always good though spring anime

"Wotakoi is a romance between young adults. Gamer guy who wears glasses and yaoi fangirl who acts like a tomboy. Apparently they aren't very confident about their own hobbies so naturally they go and announce their otaku lifestyle in a manner similar to ""yes, I am a vegan"" meme. Pretty cool.There are few things I quite like. Wotakoi has very direct dialogue, People say what they think and don't hide inside their shells. These characters are honest and don't spend 15 episodes pondering over how to convey. The comedy -especially after the first 2 episodes- is genius. The series is full of gamer memes...that feel very accurate to 90's kids (which our main characters also are). Episode 3 is a perfect example of rom-com done right.The main characters don't feel very special nor memorable. They are just normal, realistic folks who are doing the slice of life thingy. Arguably very smart choice when considering the nature of this series. Still, I found myself getting attached to them in just 2 episodes, and am already looking forward to seeing where their relationship will head. The actual romance between them is super cute and innocent. The overall execution makes Wotakoi seem like a feel-good series.At first, the side characters seem pretty dull, and come off quite comedic, but soon turns out they are pretty much the same as our main pair, just not in the lead role in this series. This is something to which I typically pay a lot attention, but this time our side characters are actually real characters and not filler people. I can appreciate that.The art and animation are rather typical. Nothing note-worthy in terms of good or bad. It has chosen the safe route, which is fine. The seiyuus consist of some big names, but none which voice I have yet grown tired of hearing, so I have no problems with that. When it comes to the OST, I have been too busy giggling at the cute romance scenes so I completely did not pay attention to any of the songs or if there even were any present. I only recall the video game BGM from episode 1. The series made a good job on making me forget that I was watching an anime. This is pretty much the perfect prove -for myself at least- that it is a decent show.",wotakoi romance young adult gamer guy wear glass yaoi fangirl act like tomboy apparently arent confident hobby naturally go announce otaku lifestyle manner similar yes vegan meme pretty coolthere thing quite like wotakoi direct dialogue people say think dont hide inside shell character honest dont spend episode pondering convey comedy especially first episode genius series full gamer memesthat feel accurate kid main character also episode perfect example romcom done rightthe main character dont feel special memorable normal realistic folk slice life thingy arguably smart choice considering nature series still found getting attached episode already looking forward seeing relationship head actual romance super cute innocent overall execution make wotakoi seem like feelgood seriesat first side character seem pretty dull come quite comedic soon turn pretty much main pair lead role series something typically pay lot attention time side character actually real character filler people appreciate thatthe art animation rather typical nothing noteworthy term good bad chosen safe route fine seiyuus consist big name none voice yet grown tired hearing problem come ost busy giggling cute romance scene completely pay attention song even present recall video game bgm episode series made good job making forget watching anime pretty much perfect prove least decent show,positive,0.2087706511175898,0.5604956268221575
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (or simply Wotakoi), have two genres. Comedy and romance. That's it. Romcoms nowadays in the anime community has been popular in the late 2010's sparking a big genre called ''School''.Yet Im not talking about the ''School'' genre here. Im talking about how Wotakoi done an excellent job on progressing and making unique attempts on a Romantic-comedy segment that is surprisingly not taking place in a high school. Instead it follows the workplace of four unique characters. Unique as in every single one of this four have unique attributes that you can say ''How in the world does this four have...a partner with their attitudes?''.The story revolves mainly on the four characters of the show. Inspite of that, each episode offers uniqueness and heart-warming scenes that can make either audience feel comfortable or laugh at. It mainly focus on the lives of Nifuji Hirotaka (the quiet, not that sociable gamer), Momose Narumi (the cute, sparkling otaku and yaoi fan), Kabakura Tarou (the guy you always meet in the bar who looks like a thug but has a genuine heart) and Koyanagi Hanako (the cosplaying-loving woman and the only one who can stand-up against Kabakura.) Each episodes offers rare shots from a Rom-com like any other. Instead of doing classwork, they do office work. They are not students. They are adults. The fact that Wotakoi stands out this season is that its not like your typical high school drama like Tada-kun this season. It shows the picture of office workers and adulthood. The one thing that made this anime different to our ''in-real-life'' adulthood is that, Wotakoi still offers the taste of an otaku. Whether your a figurine collector, gamer, yaoi fan, manga fan or an anime fan, you can relate to either one or two or even every single character from these four and will make you laugh out loud. Its not only the environment is unique. The love story of this four as well. The fact that each character, have different taste, interest and attitude made them understand each other is truly inspiring. That is what you call friendship. Real friendship and that exist on the adulthood. I'm not against to the current status of Rom-coms on anime being on a high school environment. I mean some are good. Some are average. Although one thing is certain.. is that Wotakoi can upgrade the romantic-comedy segment into a whole new level.Every anime comes down into judging it by art, and Wotakoi, in all honesty, made it average on my opinion. Average although watchable. You don't need a very good animation for a romantic-comedy and all. This is not action. Although I would love to note that the animation used in the gaming episode and the opening is excellent.Speaking of the opening, this is one of those openings I added to my anime playlists because its just too good. Along with the animation and the dance (hands) choreography on the chorus of the opening, it is a great way to start off the episode. The ending as well. With its art picturing the characters like going home from a busy day of work to sleeping, with a cheerful singing, its just fit to the theme of Wotakoi.Overall, this anime when I first saw it on the PV or trailer, I was expecting it to be a good take for romance and comedy genre and I was not disappointed going through the 11 episodes. Wotakoi is good uptake of the genre and I rated it this high because of its story, mixing it with well-developed characters, fine animation, heart-warming openings and endings, and a good comedic material.",wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii simply wotakoi two genre comedy romance thats romcoms nowadays anime community popular late sparking big genre called schoolyet im talking school genre im talking wotakoi done excellent job progressing making unique attempt romanticcomedy segment surprisingly taking place high school instead follows workplace four unique character unique every single one four unique attribute say world four havea partner attitudesthe story revolves mainly four character show inspite episode offer uniqueness heartwarming scene make either audience feel comfortable laugh mainly focus life nifuji hirotaka quiet sociable gamer momose narumi cute sparkling otaku yaoi fan kabakura tarou guy always meet bar look like thug genuine heart koyanagi hanako cosplayingloving woman one standup kabakura episode offer rare shot romcom like instead classwork office work student adult fact wotakoi stand season like typical high school drama like tadakun season show picture office worker adulthood one thing made anime different inreallife adulthood wotakoi still offer taste otaku whether figurine collector gamer yaoi fan manga fan anime fan relate either one two even every single character four make laugh loud environment unique love story four well fact character different taste interest attitude made understand truly inspiring call friendship real friendship exist adulthood im current status romcoms anime high school environment mean good average although one thing certain wotakoi upgrade romanticcomedy segment whole new levelevery anime come judging art wotakoi honesty made average opinion average although watchable dont need good animation romanticcomedy action although would love note animation used gaming episode opening excellentspeaking opening one opening added anime playlist good along animation dance hand choreography chorus opening great way start episode ending well art picturing character like going home busy day work sleeping cheerful singing fit theme wotakoioverall anime first saw pv trailer expecting good take romance comedy genre disappointed going episode wotakoi good uptake genre rated high story mixing welldeveloped character fine animation heartwarming opening ending good comedic material,positive,0.25164255335307956,0.5647810814916079

"Wotaku ni koi muzukashii (or Wotakoi for short) is a really nice and cute anime.Now I have seen some comments saying that this anime has no plot and is just the daily lives of some otaku people. Have you not heard of Slice of Life? This is very much a slice of life, it has little to no plot but is just stuff that happens nearly on the daily. It is nice.The comedy also nicely hits, usually, if an anime is boring I find myself skipping a lot, but this anime I do not skip times so that is good.The story is about these...4 people, and they are otakus (nerds). One of them like Yaoi, one is a cosplayer, one loves video games, one loves collecting idols, etc. There are 2 couples in those people, and they are very open about their nerdiness in front of each other. It is very wholesome.This anime appeases the otaku fandom and romanticizes them in my opinion. Sure nothing wrong with loving a hobby, but being that engrossed in something to the point where it affects your relationship is wild and is romanticized here.The music is nice.OP is really really good, music is nice and all but OP animation is amazing.Animation quality is also really good. I liked it.Overall really nice show!8/10 still not really life-changing as I would give 9 or 10/10's.

"I hate long reviews myself, so I'm gonna make it short. Full disclaimer, I dropped it after watching 6 episodes.MC - Main CharacterFMC - Female Main CharacterThis is not a romance anime even though it has the romance tag. The pathetic amount of romance it has is pretty one-sided and goes nowhere.Someone needs to tell these mangakas that there needs to be progress and not at a turtle speed. I mean, the premise was good, but I was expecting the main couple to start developing feelings for one another over time but that never happened.By the 6 episode, it was clear to me that the...MC liked the FMC but there was no sign of romantic interest from the FMC side. Hell, she treated other male characters better than she did the MC, and on top of that, it was pretty clear that the MC wasn't even her type, meaning she was not attracted to him, which is fine by me but ONLY if it slowly starts to change. Sadly, as I said, it did not.Overall: I was pretty disappointed because I did not get what I wanted from the show. One-sided love is not fun to watch especially if it does not develop into something more. A rom-com that has VERY little romance.Recommendation: Skip it. There are far better rom-coms out there such as Kamisama Hajimemashita.",hate long review im gon na make short full disclaimer dropped watching episodesmc main characterfmc female main characterthis romance anime even though romance tag pathetic amount romance pretty onesided go nowheresomeone need tell mangakas need progress turtle speed mean premise good expecting main couple start developing feeling one another time never happenedby episode clear themc liked fmc sign romantic interest fmc side hell treated male character better mc top pretty clear mc wasnt even type meaning attracted fine slowly start change sadly said notoverall pretty disappointed get wanted show onesided love fun watch especially develop something romcom little romancerecommendation skip far better romcoms kamisama hajimemashita,positive,0.06505376344086021,0.587768817204301
"I'm wondering what's happening with slice of life shows lately.It's as if anime producers had a secret consensus, and on it they decided they'll sneak in non-existent plot into shows, and focus on making money with as little effort as possible. News flash: just because a show has slice of life genre in it, it doesn't allow it to be boring to the point of being a comatose-inducing drug.I can give you endless examples of other shows being super interesting regardless of main theme simply tracking a character or characters' lives or other barely existing plot examples. Wotakoi went off rails with plot less than...mid-way through, and decided to show filler episodes instead.Now, I haven't read the manga and perhaps it's different in it, but it doesn't excuse the poor, or rather, a complete lack of pacing and direction, resulting in my lack of engagement.Slightly annoying factor is that the shows such as this one somehow get a pass by an average person's critique and are now considered quality shows, when they are not. I get that by making the setting as uncomplicated as possible, you know, just a regular present day, no supernatural circumstances, or no deep psychological battle mysteries like known to all Death Note, no melodrama or different harem routes, none of that shit, it's guaranteed to avoid pretty much any illogical executions, events, inconsistencies or plot holes, like many action series suffer from for example, but there's no excuse for having a lack of guidance altogether and just call it quits.Atmosphere is lovely, characters are sympathetic, it's bundled in nice, shiny wrappings, the overall presentation is great, yet it ultimately fails to deliver any conclusion, it's too tedious and lacks life. I'm sorry but this will not go unnoticed by some people, myself included.I don't hate this show by a long shot, but I don't know how and/or why do these types of shows always leave a bad taste in my mouth.",im wondering whats happening slice life show latelyits anime producer secret consensus decided theyll sneak nonexistent plot show focus making money little effort possible news flash show slice life genre doesnt allow boring point comatoseinducing drugi give endless example show super interesting regardless main theme simply tracking character character life barely existing plot example wotakoi went rail plot less thanmidway decided show filler episode insteadnow havent read manga perhaps different doesnt excuse poor rather complete lack pacing direction resulting lack engagementslightly annoying factor show one somehow get pas average person critique considered quality show get making setting uncomplicated possible know regular present day supernatural circumstance deep psychological battle mystery like known death note melodrama different harem route none shit guaranteed avoid pretty much illogical execution event inconsistency plot hole like many action series suffer example there excuse lack guidance altogether call quitsatmosphere lovely character sympathetic bundled nice shiny wrapping overall presentation great yet ultimately fails deliver conclusion tedious lack life im sorry go unnoticed people includedi dont hate show long shot dont know andor type show always leave bad taste mouth,negative,-0.05377906976744186,0.5321875798619984
"TL;DR It's a 7/10 show that is not meant for everyone. If romcoms are not your genre or want a romance that heavily focuses on development like Tsuki ga Kirei, then I wouldn't recommend it. The humor is good. The Opening is probably the best this season. However, I don't think the 3 episode rule applies here, if you don't like Romantic-Comedies.Wotakoi is a romantic-comedy that steps into the light of adulthood, and basks in the glory of being an Otaku? I'm just kidding. Being an otaku in society is still seen as a overall negative from all the weird things like Hentai and Cosplay...making people seem deranged for dressing as weird fantasy characters...BUT THAT'S GETTING OFF TOPIC. Anyways, Wotakoi is a light-hearted anime that really brings out what makes the romcom scene enjoyable. The character dynamics between all three of the couples: Narumi x Hirotaka ; Kabakura x Koyanagi ; Naoya x Kou, add a level of chemistry and flavor that never steps into disturbing or overbearing with its amount of fluff.Those who are expecting a fully-developed story with lots of romantic progression or character development are going to be sadly disappointed though. Neither of those elements get pushed forward. But, that isn't mean they aren't nurtured. Throughout the entire 11 episodes, the emotions and affection that we see nurtured throughout the entire series, while small, are noticeably different from episode 1 to the ending.Is this a show that everyone should watch? No. I don't think everyone is going to enjoy Wotakoi. It's an anime that feels like it was produced and developed for people like myself who grew up with Romantic-Comedies, and understand that speed is an aspect that rarely happens within these shows.",tldr show meant everyone romcoms genre want romance heavily focus development like tsuki ga kirei wouldnt recommend humor good opening probably best season however dont think episode rule applies dont like romanticcomedieswotakoi romanticcomedy step light adulthood basks glory otaku im kidding otaku society still seen overall negative weird thing like hentai cosplaymaking people seem deranged dressing weird fantasy charactersbut thats getting topic anyways wotakoi lighthearted anime really brings make romcom scene enjoyable character dynamic three couple narumi x hirotaka kabakura x koyanagi naoya x kou add level chemistry flavor never step disturbing overbearing amount fluffthose expecting fullydeveloped story lot romantic progression character development going sadly disappointed though neither element get pushed forward isnt mean arent nurtured throughout entire episode emotion affection see nurtured throughout entire series small noticeably different episode endingis show everyone watch dont think everyone going enjoy wotakoi anime feel like produced developed people like grew romanticcomedies understand speed aspect rarely happens within show,positive,0.013068181818181812,0.5524621212121212
"Ok, so I tried so hard to like this show, I did. I fell in love with megane, (the show is so dreadful I only remember two people's names and they are side characters) at first but then he became so dull as a person, and not because of the cold-monotone personality they were trying to go for. He just was.Pink Hair chick, Momose (I had to open the info tab to get their names), is annoying, loud, and on more than one occasion admits she isn't attracted to her boyfriend. Now they go over this in the show where it could be a relationship...of convenience, (yes, yes it is), but it doesn't get resolved. These two have known each other since childhood, yet this moron doesn't know enough about him to be considered an acquaintance. I had to watch this more than once in case I missed things, sadly, I didn't.Now Gingertoki (Kabakura) and Green Haired chick (Hanako) are like the worst example of a couple. Now, everyone has arguments here and there, especially when both people are stubborn, but f***ing dammit. Him calling her a hag is not cute. Her forcing him to do things isn't cute. They get into a fight and it doesn't even get resolved and it pisses me off. It's unhealthy this type of arguing. They only gave them a couple of good eps and even then it didn't last. Like before it became 100% established that they were dating they were better with each other, then it's made clear and they're at each other's throats just for breathing weird. There is so much they have to work on for a couple that's been together for a decade.It was hard for me to believe that Hirotaka ever had a thing for this dumb chick since childhood. Like it all seemed forced.For all those people that loved it for not being the high school show where it takes ages for the couple to admit their feelings, you have been tricked with this show. These two dated because ""why not we're both otakus"" (worst reason), and throughout the show they couldn't admit their feelings. He didn't tell her how long he liked her for, she was still uncertain of the whole relationship the whole damn time, she was still not attracted to him until he removed his glasses and other chicks wanted him. Saying she hadn't seen him like that. Honestly, I can barely see them as friends. It's not that they're going slow, there is no fucking chemistry, hell there was more chemistry with Momose  (I did it, I remembered a name without having to look back) and Naoya. This whole show was Momose wondering if she loved Megane. They are literally acting like those kids that think they should date because they have things in common, but they really shouldn't because they just don't mesh well. So it is another high school show where the lead couple won't admit their feelings or act on them. It's just been dressed up differently.Now the one thing that wasn't resolved and I fear it will be for  season 2 that this show doesn't deserve, is the relationship with Naoya and Kou. Now those two were believable as a potential couple. It's like the writers spent more time making those two likable. Those seriously are the only ones I'm rooting for and even like. If there is a season 2, I won't watch it,  but at least resolve something.I give Garbagetaku a 2/10 only bc I love Naoya and Kou.",ok tried hard like show fell love megane show dreadful remember two people name side character first became dull person coldmonotone personality trying go waspink hair chick momose open info tab get name annoying loud one occasion admits isnt attracted boyfriend go show could relationshipof convenience yes yes doesnt get resolved two known since childhood yet moron doesnt know enough considered acquaintance watch case missed thing sadly didntnow gingertoki kabakura green haired chick hanako like worst example couple everyone argument especially people stubborn fing dammit calling hag cute forcing thing isnt cute get fight doesnt even get resolved piss unhealthy type arguing gave couple good eps even didnt last like became established dating better made clear theyre others throat breathing weird much work couple thats together decadeit hard believe hirotaka ever thing dumb chick since childhood like seemed forcedfor people loved high school show take age couple admit feeling tricked show two dated otakus worst reason throughout show couldnt admit feeling didnt tell long liked still uncertain whole relationship whole damn time still attracted removed glass chick wanted saying hadnt seen like honestly barely see friend theyre going slow fucking chemistry hell chemistry momose remembered name without look back naoya whole show momose wondering loved megane literally acting like kid think date thing common really shouldnt dont mesh well another high school show lead couple wont admit feeling act dressed differentlynow one thing wasnt resolved fear season show doesnt deserve relationship naoya kou two believable potential couple like writer spent time making two likable seriously one im rooting even like season wont watch least resolve somethingi give garbagetaku bc love naoya kou,negative,-0.01826666666666667,0.5762666666666666
"Honestly, I'm sure If I should do a full review on this anime, just because it feels like there is more to come. It ended on such a weird note and it made you feel like there was another episode to watch after 11.However, considering that this was a fairly recent anime and the world as we all know is going through a pandemic, it can be fairly difficult to release more episodes since it takes a considerable amount of time to draw and animate adaptations from a manga.With that out of the way lemme break down why I have given ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard...for Otaku"" a 10/10.Story - 10/10Firstly, growing up from a kid to an adult can be scary and also exciting at the same time. We all have our own favorite hobbies, interests, or that dirty little secret that you just want to keep quiet about, and believe me I have few secrets which I would never share with anyone, no matter who they are.Nowadays, people don't like to admit it but it's part of our society and how we live in. This anime essentially touches on that topic, the English translation of the title is ""It's Difficult to Love an Otaku"" which if your living underneath a rock essentially means it's difficult to find love while you personally love all things anime and manga-related.Bring in characters that are exactly like that and work together in an office can bring an interesting storyline on what a possible scenario outcome would be. Welcome to a story of office romance, finding love, and a strong culture of otakus and gamers.Now, for those who watch anime and read manga on a daily basis, you can heavily relate to this show as it can be hard to find love or a potential relationship if someone like you watches this kind of thing. Opening up about this sort of topic can tell a lot about your personality and sharing it with friends can be a difficult experience too. You have no idea how your friend might react once they know you like watching anime and reading manga. Some people would take it and blow it out of proportion and make fun of you, call you names, and eventually that friendship would fizzle, it's the same sort of thing if you had a girlfriend/boyfriend, and during this anime one character by the name of Narumi, Momose had that exact same experience and her relationship with her boyfriend, it fizzled then died. She then, therefore, vowed to herself that she would keep her love for anime and manga a secret and would never share it with anyone unless they like the same thing.This anime's story was truly sweet, cute, funny, and quirky at the same time. The plot twists were fairly minimal and you can follow the story of a relationship-building between Hirotaka and Narumi.Art - 9/10As always, the art was truly well done. The design of the characters looked great, but I guess it took me a while to adjust to the eyes of certain characters, but only because most of the other anime's I have watched, the character's eyes were big and bold.I did however get used to it but anything slightly different than the eye design in this anime would kinda put me off.However, overall, the art and surroundings were superb and it really set the tone well.Sound - 9/10Fabulous, nothing else much to say. The opening was so catchy and so cheery it was perfect to hum along to when starting a new episode and that ending theme, my god, was utterly brilliant. I have even edited that soundtrack and turned it into a mobile phone/cell phone ringtone, it is that good. Of course, the soundtracks within the anime complemented all the scenes really well.Character - 10/10I think I've covered most of this section in the art and story sections but I guess I could say a few words here and try not to repeat myself. The character's in this anime were truly well portrayed and it made an all-around enjoyable experience to watch. The personality's of the characters were really interesting to learn about;:- a girl with an obsessed love interest for anime and manga.:- a boy who loves gaming and would not eat, drink or sleep during a vacation and just keep playing his games.:- a girl who loves cosplaying as a guy (very interesting indeed, I wonder how she hid those humungous hungolomghnonoloughongous) while she was cosplaying.and finally:- a guy who likes watching anime and reading mangaIt made the entire story and experience of this anime and really enjoyable one, I just wish there were more episodes, but I guess it's the waiting game now, hmmm.Overall - 10/10This anime was really good and I really enjoyed it, I would like to thank all my otaku friends for recommending me this anime, a solid choice and yes I would recommend this anime to all my friends who haven't seen it.Well, that pretty much sum's up my review for ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"", if more episodes come out, I might add more but for now, time to watch another anime.Thank you very much for reading if you got this far, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.cryyptt_ <3",honestly im sure full review anime feel like come ended weird note made feel like another episode watch however considering fairly recent anime world know going pandemic fairly difficult release episode since take considerable amount time draw animate adaptation mangawith way lem break given wotakoi love hardfor otaku story firstly growing kid adult scary also exciting time favorite hobby interest dirty little secret want keep quiet believe secret would never share anyone matter arenowadays people dont like admit part society live anime essentially touch topic english translation title difficult love otaku living underneath rock essentially mean difficult find love personally love thing anime mangarelatedbring character exactly like work together office bring interesting storyline possible scenario outcome would welcome story office romance finding love strong culture otakus gamersnow watch anime read manga daily basis heavily relate show hard find love potential relationship someone like watch kind thing opening sort topic tell lot personality sharing friend difficult experience idea friend might react know like watching anime reading manga people would take blow proportion make fun call name eventually friendship would fizzle sort thing girlfriendboyfriend anime one character name narumi momose exact experience relationship boyfriend fizzled died therefore vowed would keep love anime manga secret would never share anyone unless like thingthis anime story truly sweet cute funny quirky time plot twist fairly minimal follow story relationshipbuilding hirotaka narumiart always art truly well done design character looked great guess took adjust eye certain character anime watched character eye big boldi however get used anything slightly different eye design anime would kinda put offhowever overall art surroundings superb really set tone wellsound fabulous nothing else much say opening catchy cheery perfect hum along starting new episode ending theme god utterly brilliant even edited soundtrack turned mobile phonecell phone ringtone good course soundtrack within anime complemented scene really wellcharacter think ive covered section art story section guess could say word try repeat character anime truly well portrayed made allaround enjoyable experience watch personality character really interesting learn girl obsessed love interest anime manga boy love gaming would eat drink sleep vacation keep playing game girl love cosplaying guy interesting indeed wonder hid humungous hungolomghnonoloughongous cosplayingand finally guy like watching anime reading mangait made entire story experience anime really enjoyable one wish episode guess waiting game hmmmoverall anime really good really enjoyed would like thank otaku friend recommending anime solid choice yes would recommend anime friend havent seen itwell pretty much sum review wotakoi love hard otaku episode come might add time watch another animethank much reading got far hope enjoy rest daycryyptt,positive,0.17775596496526727,0.6123336773046079
"I'll preface this by saying that I have not read any of the manga for this series.You don't necessarily expect much to happen in a slice of life type show, but with Wotakoi, there is very little payoff. It all ends up feeling incredibly flat; each episode follows its own structure and there isn’t much of an overarching story being built. Everything is just enjoyable enough to keep you strung along hoping that something will eventually happen. And, it’s not to say that the characters don’t sometimes have their moments. There are cute interactions or jokes that land here and there, but the frequency...isn’t high enough to warrant a higher rating than a 5/10 for me.The romance is absolutely subdued here, and it doesn't really feel like much of a focus at all most of the time. Essentially, it just feels as though the show doesn't really know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a slice of life about 4 otaku nerds working in the same office? Or does the series want to try to explore a clumsy nerdy romance between two childhood friends? The show never seems to extend very far beyond: “These MCs are nerds! Wow aren’t they awkward and relatable? They’re so interested in vidya, manga and anime, perhaps like you, the viewer?”Ultimately, where this particular anime struggles is the character development. The characters are likable, but don't expect them to change much at all from the first episode to the last. Other romance anime do a better job of developing the relationship between the primary protagonists. However, this show really likes to emphasize that otaku lack social skills, which accomplishes about as much as you might think. This show truly is a slice of life at its core, and going in expecting more than that may leave you disappointed.A personal gripe for me was that a side character, Kou, is introduced far too late into the series. I really would have loved to see more of her, but there simply wasn’t enough time in an 11 episode timeframe. It was cute, and a romance could have easily bloomed there.All in all, this is a very average anime, propped up by largely forgettable, bland characters. But hey, the characters are nice to look at, and most of the voice acting is well done.

"Wotakoi is light romantic comedy of responsible adults connected by the threads of their hobby--otaku culture. The cast are adults in the workplace that were able to come together because of their common interests: games, anime, manga, and cosplay. The series draws us to the feeling of making friends that we can share our interests (ones that we do not readily share to most our friends.)The animation is adequately pleasant. The opening theme is very catchy, it had me look up on sumika--and now they are a staple on my music playlist.The characters and their interactions are enjoyable. Particularly, Narumi and Hirotaka's relationship and...how they progressed is very cute. It is something we would ponder on--dating our best friend. Starting out as childhood friends, Narumi would find it difficult to have a partner that would accept her interests. Reluctant at first, Narumi and Hirotaka got together, although in a comedic take. We would see Narumi enjoy being able to freely express her hobbies. The interesting part is how they try to figure out how to act ""normal"" in a relationship, and I see that as something amazing to see that they do not have to force it and just be themselves.Overall, the series mixes comedy, romance, and drama very well--not too much, just enough.",wotakoi light romantic comedy responsible adult connected thread hobbyotaku culture cast adult workplace able come together common interest game anime manga cosplay series draw u feeling making friend share interest one readily share friendsthe animation adequately pleasant opening theme catchy look sumikaand staple music playlistthe character interaction enjoyable particularly narumi hirotakas relationship andhow progressed cute something would ponder ondating best friend starting childhood friend narumi would find difficult partner would accept interest reluctant first narumi hirotaka got together although comedic take would see narumi enjoy able freely express hobby interesting part try figure act normal relationship see something amazing see force themselvesoverall series mix comedy romance drama wellnot much enough,positive,0.25,0.5618055555555556

"Welcome to the latest ""what if a bunch of generic teenagers were adults"" anime. Let’s see what Japan has served up this time… Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku. Well, at least it has an interesting name, it’d be even more interesting if the show had stayed true to it for at least a single episode. It didn’t, and by the end of the first episode, the main characters are already dating.Okay, that one misgiving aside, Wotakoi is a decent workplace romantic comedy with plenty of good qualities but is ultimately weighed down by poor comedic timing. Let’s first discuss what the show does well...before diving into the issues.The characters are all fairly likable, while I never found any one of them to be great, their chemistry with one another is enjoyably infectious. With a premise like otakus falling in love, characterizing it’s cast in a believable and relatable way is where the show’s main success lies. For example, the lead character Narumi is a fujoshi and likely the most otaku of the four lead characters, yet she’s never made into a caricature. Cutesy mannerism and a little pigeon-toed running aside, her hobbies seem realistic and aren’t at the butt end of jokes. It’s the same with her co-worker Koyanagi, she’s a reasonably restrained fujo in public, but a well-known cosplayer at conventions. In the first few episodes, she and Narumi slowly learn about their hobbies because you can’t just dive headlong into the subject of BL with your co-workers unless you want to get a permanent side-eye from them. And Wotakoi handles this extremely well, otaku being sort of oddballs have to exercise self-restraint when talking about their hobbies. When they meet other otakus with similar tastes, it’s like they’ve finally found people who speak their own language.It's an ideal foundation for a rom-com about otakus dating, but the lead pairing Narumi and Hirotaka already have known each other for years before they start working together, so it feels like it's not such a struggle for them to be in love. Unless if you consider the 'love is hard' to be referring to the glacial progression of the romance then I suppose it's faithful to the title.About half of the show’s screen time is spent in the office space like a typical work comedy, and the other half is on dates and drinking parties just to keep it fresh, but it's a romcom so a threadbare story structure is inevitable. What's really important is the characters, not story, but that doesn't excuse Wotakoi's stagnant narrative, which we'll discuss more in depth after the positives.The show's cast being otakus makes them better, rather than being cringely portrayed like you may expect from its ilk, it's well done and relatable. The game otaku Hirotaka (and Narumi’s childhood friend) plays and references plenty of games without it feeling forced or tacked on. If the group is going to play Mario Kart, the scene isn’t about slamming the viewer over the head with Mario jokes, but the people playing the game. Good otaku representation is always ideal in a series like this because it helps the characters to feel relatable and fills in the gaps in their characterization. And that brings us to the issues. Aside from the characters being portrayed well for the archetypes that they fill, there is very little to them as people. It feels like they selected standard romcom archetypes, mixed them with otaku archetypes, then left the characters then forgot to add much depth leaving them as placeholders for actual people. We know the bare minimum about their personalities for them to function in a romcom. There the cutesy but occasionally oblivious Narumi, the stoic deadpan Hirotaka, as well as Koyonogi's air of confidence and cleverness, and the abrasive tsundere dude Kabakura.There’s not much great character development at all. When the show gets into backstories and motivates it only goes skin deep then backs off as if it’s afraid to tell us too much about the cast. Like the scene with Hirotaka telling Narumi about his ear piercing because the guy she was dating at the time had pierced ears as well. It was kindhearted and subtle flirting like Hirotaka tends to do throughout most of the series, with Narumi being typically oblivious or sometimes considering maybe she does love the guy she’s dating. Hirotaka and Narumi flirting is comparable to trying to carve an ice sculpture with a pencil, there’s barely any momentum and the characters hardly grow by the end. It doesn’t help that the show is still adding characters by the tenth episode to digress from the lead couple.The characters are still quite watchable despite these flaws because the show's writing doesn't travel far outside of its comfort zone to create a well-rounded experience. It's a series with no noticeably bad moments, just plenty of meh ones. Wotakoi is sadly an example of; succeeding only because it did not try hard enough to risk failure.From a technical perspective, the characters are at least well designed, passionately voiced, and their hobbies are realistically detailed, and they do have chemistry. Seeing arguments that Kyabakura and Koyanagi have over BL and yuri feels like they understand their own opinions greatly like the author was pulling from real people’s experience. If only the joke delivery capitalized on the chemistry’s potential, it could have been better. The romance between the two main characters is quite stagnant, but sadly the comedy is also affected by its own pacing problems. The pacing is slow and the jokes don’t hit with much impact. Looking at how the manga delivers jokes, it's much funnier and flows better. This adaptation just feels like a moving manga, there is no consideration for pacing or how it will animate. What likely caused this is a lacking budget and a director not talented enough to improve the source material in any way.For example; sometimes we’re slapped with an intentionally unfunny joke from the po-faced Hirotaka and they just hang on screen for a painful few seconds that feel more like an hour, grinding the scene’s pace to a halt. That’s the pace of a majority of the jokes, with very little animation aside from funny reaction faces (taken from the manga). Every joke is presented with a slow lethargic pace that makes the director seem like he has no concept of how to time a joke properly. That brings us to the show’s production issues. Ok, to be fair, the op is really well done. It’s dynamic, well edited, and offers plenty of details on the character’s personalities.The main cast having anime colored hair to help them stand out from the background is a bit jarring considering the blandness of their work environment. Speaking of which, often times it seems like the four leads are the only ones who work at the company. It’s partially excusable when they’re in a relatively small 6 cubicle office space. When wacky hijinks ensue and the four of them are running all throughout the building I can’t help but wonder if A-1 couldn’t spare the animation or if the writer couldn’t make the jokes funny enough without having to unrealistically remove all of the background characters. I suppose it’s better than the CGI crowds the show regularly uses. The end result is still somewhat funny if a bit unrealistic if only it didn’t bend the audience’s suspension of disbelief to get to the comedy. It’s scenes like this that make you wonder if the show would have been better if it were adapted by a different studio.Ah, if you noticed that I skipped over Kabakura when talking about what I liked about the characters, that was intentional. I think he’s a jerk who treats Hanako like an asshole then occasionally makes it up to her by doing one nice thing. The friction between him and Hanako actually gave the show a chance to explore that theme of love being hard for otaku, but instead, the conflict is reduced to: they’re together because they always have been. That itself is a message, that otaku don’t have many options, but it’s not a dynamic that you can just sweep under the rug. It should have been discussed because relationships like that do have negative effects on those involved, but like I mentioned there’s no discussion it’s just ""oh I’m sorry, have this gift and we’ll go back to normal"". They had some nicer scenes in the later half of the show, with them discussing yaoi versus yuri, and it’s genuinely nice. But it needed to be more than just moderately pleasant, there needed to be more substance or at least effective comedy.Having relatable and uplifting themes is great, but a show should still be compelling on its own and that’s where Wotakoi disappoints. The characters are likable for their strong personalities and in-depth hobbies, but they lack the development needed to be truly memorable. Even if the jokes weren't timed so poorly, this series is still lacking, but it sure could have helped if they hired a director with a better understanding of comedic timing.",welcome latest bunch

"A workplace romance comedy about otaku's going into a relationship?..LA's in!To be absolutely honest, LA didn't think too much of Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii but after watching the anime, heck from the FIRST episode alone, the anime resonated with LA, both in it's romance and comedic elements but especially with it's characters of course.Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii a character-centric, but to be precise a relationship-centric anime and for it being a rom-com about otaku couples, this is a given. It follows Narumi Momose voiced by Arisa Date who has gotten a new job however she bumps into her childhood friend Hirotaka Nifuji voiced...by Kento Itou and blurts out that she's an otaku to her superiors, the thing is Narumi shifted jobs because of her obsession with anime and manga and being a fujoshi and kept it hidden to her normie boyfriends. Here's another thing, Hirotaka's and Narumi's superiors, well they are otaku's as well, Tarou Kabakura voiced by Di- Tomokazu Sugita, Hirotaka's superior and friend at work who is a huge manga fan, while Hanako Koyanagi voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro is Narumi's and a somewhat famous cosplayer and massive BL fan. Anyways with Narumi depressed that her secret's out, Hirotaka ventured that maybe he could be her boyfriend and support Narumi with her hobby and her in turn as well.And then and there, LA could already root for Hirotaka and Narumi's relationship with how many things they can relate with one another whilst having very different personalities, whilst Kabakura and Hanako's relationship is the polar opposite, yes they fight ALOT within the anime but them like Hirotaka and Narumi being childhood friends, their fighting subsides and they look at the bigger picture for both themselves as well as Hirotaka and Narumi and because of this, LA rooted for both of their relationships to work out and not many animes have LA rooting for BOTH beta and main couples but Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii did it!It's the character chemistry with Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii that just clicks with you and ALSO relatable at that. LA being very much similar to Hirotaka in a ways (but with anime instead of games) and LA's favorite character being Narumi so there was that, but seeing the four main characters just talking, having fun and helping each other with games, Comiket, watching anime, MMORPG's and with their love life out just made each of the core cast very solid, both individually and with their relationships as well, you know that they're friends and their actions bloody shows it and the factor of the entire otaku element is just icing in the cake for LA.With that, the comedy does have the typical character jabbing at times, but it also goes into anime references ALOT (especially with A1-Pictures previous works) as well as gaming and some of the comedy does involve observational jokes but they have all the great reaction timing and great voice acting that applies towards it that LA laughed ALOT in this anime and you know what LA says about comedies...it's all subjective, but the second one being if it'll make you laugh, it's done it's job.In terms of animation done by A1-Pictures, well LA has to give A1-Pictures props towards it's character designs, being distinguishable and distinct but even for such a minimalistic cast, A1-Pictures did great on the backgrounding work even if it's mainly work, Hirotaka's house and the gaming world but nonetheless, without needing the characters to say it you know what's what...even if the surtitles give it away anyways but semantics.For voice acting, well we have mostly veteran voice actors like Celt- Miyuki Sawashiro, Di- Tomokazu Sugita, Ere- Yuki Kaji as Hirotaka's younger brother and Hibi- Aoi Yuuki so typically it would be a great cast, but our two main couple of Hirotaka and Narumi are some fresh new voices, that of Kento Itou and Arisa Date, Kento Itou has been in iDOLM@STER SideM as Michio Hazama, but as Hirotaka he's does a great job in portraying the laid back, stoic gaming otaku even if he's pretty deadpan most of the time but nonetheless. The obvious standout the the best til last...goes to Arisa Date and LA actually knows of Arisa because she was casted in iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls (Huh, Arisa and Kento were both in iDOLM@STER spinoffs before doing this anime...coincidence?) as Emi Namba, the comedienne idol and now Arisa is flexing her chops as Narumi and LA just loved her acting throughout the anime, what's the best way of saying her vocal range was like, like a higher pitched (but controlled) and EVEN MORE HYPER Ayane Sakura and her overreactions were priceless to say the least, maybe some bias towards LA liking Narumi but still LA will MVP to Arisa Date nonetheless for her brilliant reactionary range, she was not only a perfect fit for Emi Namba but Narumi as well, hope she'll get more roles!*ahem* Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a brilliant down to earth, hilariously funny romcom about otaku's for otaku's like us with a solid cast and characters with some decent production value and a brilliant voice cast.Love doesn't seem hard for these otaku..LA is jealous.",workplace romance comedy otakus going relationshiplas absolutely honest la didnt think much wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii watching anime heck first episode alone anime resonated la romance comedic element especially character coursewotaku ni koi wa muzukashii charactercentric precise relationshipcentric anime romcom otaku couple given follows narumi momose voiced arisa date gotten new job however bump childhood friend hirotaka nifuji voicedby kento itou blurts shes otaku superior thing narumi shifted job obsession anime manga fujoshi kept hidden normie boyfriend here another thing hirotakas narumis superior well otakus well tarou kabakura voiced di tomokazu sugita hirotakas superior friend work huge manga fan hanako koyanagi voiced miyuki sawashiro narumis somewhat famous cosplayer massive bl fan anyways narumi depressed secret hirotaka ventured maybe could boyfriend support narumi hobby turn welland la could already root hirotaka narumis relationship many thing relate one another whilst different personality whilst kabakura hanakos relationship polar opposite yes fight alot within anime like hirotaka narumi childhood friend fighting subsides look bigger picture well hirotaka narumi la rooted relationship work many anime la rooting beta main couple wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii itits character chemistry wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii click also relatable la much similar hirotaka way anime instead game la favorite character narumi seeing four main character talking fun helping game comiket watching anime mmorpgs love life made core cast solid individually relationship well know theyre friend action bloody show factor entire otaku element icing cake lawith comedy typical character jabbing time also go anime reference alot especially apictures previous work well gaming comedy involve observational joke great reaction timing great voice acting applies towards la laughed alot anime know la say comediesits subjective second one itll make laugh done jobin term animation done apictures well la give apictures prop towards character design distinguishable distinct even minimalistic cast apictures great backgrounding work even mainly work hirotakas house gaming world nonetheless without needing character say know whats whateven surtitle give away anyways semanticsfor voice acting well mostly veteran voice actor like celt miyuki sawashiro di tomokazu sugita ere yuki kaji hirotakas younger brother hibi aoi yuuki typically would great cast two main couple hirotaka narumi fresh new voice kento itou arisa date kento itou idolmster sidem michio hazama hirotaka he great job portraying laid back stoic gaming otaku even he pretty deadpan time nonetheless obvious standout best til lastgoes arisa date la actually know arisa casted idolmster cinderella girl huh arisa kento idolmster spinoffs animecoincidence emi namba comedienne idol arisa flexing chop narumi la loved acting throughout anime whats best way saying vocal range like like higher pitched controlled even hyper ayane sakura overreaction priceless say least maybe bias towards la liking narumi still la mvp arisa date nonetheless brilliant reactionary range perfect fit emi namba narumi well hope shell get rolesahem wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii brilliant earth hilariously funny romcom otakus otakus like u solid cast character decent production value brilliant voice castlove doesnt seem hard otakula jealous,positive,0.24285858585858583,0.5207878787878788
"Once again, I found another reason why A-1 Pictures should focus on making romance comedy anime rather than action anime. One reason is with this anime, A-1 Pictures crews proofed themselves that they excel in writing short plots or building a character within those plots. Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii or Wotakoi, if you don't like to stumble your tongue, is an anime about love story and friendship between otakus in a working environment. The premise itself is very enough to drag me into watching this anime as I am an otaku who will enter the working society very soon.From many romance anime I have...ever watched, this anime maybe the closest one to reality as I really know that many people resent otaku for some unknown reason and dating another otaku maybe the only solution if you do not want to stay single. Enter the life of a fujoshi who just switched to a new job after her true nature as a fujoshi discovered by her ex-boyfriend who resent her for being one. She eventually surrounded by other otakus in her new job starting from her childhood friend game otaku, to a cross-dressing cosplayer otaku, and to an Evangelion loving otaku. What makes the story special to me is how we could relate to the situations happen in this anime making this anime so much immersive on its own especially if you are a hardcore otaku.I love how they depict each of their character as different kinds of otaku stereotypes. It gave us a more real perspective on otaku since nobody love everything. In the real anime community, we have different kinds of opinion and genre we love personally. Not rare that we fought each other just because our opinion over a genre or even over a best girl and I think that makes Wotakoi attached to me. This different spectrum in their characters makes us easier to relate and enjoy the plot even more.Of course, I really love how they slip otaku references here and there. Somehow reference jokes are always making me laugh and Wotakoi really did their job by making a good punchline for each of that reference joke. For you who really loves to pick many easter eggs along your way, this anime is perfect for you.Oh yeah! You definitely should check the opening song. I really love that opening song that being sung by sumika. It is catchy and really sticks to the romance comedy vibe that this anime offers to us.Overall, this anime really made me attached as I could relate to many things happened in this anime and every instances in this anime felt real and could happen anywhere and anytime in the real time. I would really like to see more of this potential as I hope they roll another season for this anime.",found another reason picture focus making romance comedy anime rather action anime one reason anime picture crew proofed excel writing short plot building character within plot wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii wotakoi dont like stumble tongue anime love story friendship otakus working environment premise enough drag watching anime otaku enter working society soonfrom many romance anime haveever watched anime maybe closest one reality really know many people resent otaku unknown reason dating another otaku maybe solution want stay single enter life fujoshi switched new job true nature fujoshi discovered exboyfriend resent one eventually surrounded otakus new job starting childhood friend game otaku crossdressing cosplayer otaku evangelion loving otaku make story special could relate situation happen anime making anime much immersive especially hardcore otakui love depict character different kind otaku stereotype gave u real perspective otaku since nobody love everything real anime community different kind opinion genre love personally rare fought opinion genre even best girl think make wotakoi attached different spectrum character make u easier relate enjoy plot even moreof course really love slip otaku reference somehow reference joke always making laugh wotakoi really job making good punchline reference joke really love pick many easter egg along way anime perfect youoh yeah definitely check opening song really love opening song sung sumika catchy really stick romance comedy vibe anime offer usoverall anime really made attached could relate many thing happened anime every instance anime felt real could happen anywhere anytime real time would really like see potential hope roll another season anime,positive,0.2726212562947256,0.4809313985334395
"Wotakoi is probably one of the best rom comedy that I watched. It has a simple plot but is well done. Instead of the typical high school romance setting, this is set in a typical Japan office workplace with otaku adults. It mainly focuses on two couples and what they do after work. The main couple is Narumi, a closet otaku and then Hirotaka, a big gamer who doesn't really try to hide that fact. The other couple is Koyanagi and Kabakura, and they are sport otaku who tend to argue a lot. I love the scenes where they game, go out to drink, and...just share their bond for anime/manga. This makes it more relatable for me at least. The show touches up on the struggles in their relationships but has a lot of cute moments as well as the characters try to change and improve their relationship. There's not much drama and the comedy blends in really nice! It's so cute too and I love the game references. (ex. mario kart!!) There's nothing unique about the show, but the fact that it's so relatable makes it so much fun to watch. Who doesn't play games after work or watch anime?!OP and ED are very good and I can't stop listening to the ED. This show was probably my favorite this season excluding the long shonen anime.",wotakoi probably one best rom comedy watched simple plot well done instead typical high school romance setting set typical japan office workplace otaku adult mainly focus two couple work main couple narumi closet otaku hirotaka big gamer doesnt really try hide fact couple koyanagi kabakura sport otaku tend argue lot love scene game go drink andjust share bond animemanga make relatable least show touch struggle relationship lot cute moment well character try change improve relationship there much drama comedy blend really nice cute love game reference ex mario kart there nothing unique show fact relatable make much fun watch doesnt play game work watch animeop ed good cant stop listening ed show probably favorite season excluding long shonen anime,positive,0.1834,0.506552380952381
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii: The King of Rom Com anime has arrivedHonestly, I think the only thing I could criticize about Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is that it had only 11 episodes. What a great series!In my first impressions I already said that this series could be the revelation of the season; however, I must say that I was wrong. Why? Because I was too short. This series came to fight the top in the top of best romantic comedy anime.When a series has good characters, is daring to establish the plot, manages to create great and fun scripts from the setting, is...able to develop its characters without having a defined core plot, shows the couple's relationship realistically, has a very good soundtrack; and has a direction that manages to blend all of the above in a brilliant way, how will not you fight for the top?And I am leaving out many other points in favor of Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii, or Wotakoi as it is known in the community. I could have added that the series has lots of references to other works or products of anime, manga, cinema, theater and even advertisements; or that this anime did not hesitate to start from the get-go with its two main couples already established.In fact, to further subvert that legendary cliché that the leading couple must be established in the epilogue; the setting established that Hanako and Tarou had been dating together for years before the beginning of the series. What happens is that it was overshadowed by the fact that Narumi and Hirotaka started dating right at the end of the first episode.Of course, here it is necessary to point out that all this argument comes from the original material. The manga created by Fujita already has the couples perfectly built, so the great merit of Yoshimasa Hiraike in directing the anime and writing the scripts was to achieve an excellent adaptation.From there, those who saw this series witnessed a masterful development that included several key aspects: 1) A humor that feels fresh and natural. Gone are those formulas of forced scenes, of sexual jokes for elementary school children, of exploitation of the child from the beginning or of the genre of the false Japanese harem.And many could say that this was because the protagonists were adults; However, in others they also have adult protagonists and yet the creators make them behave worse than a teenager. In fact, in many series (including several), one of the main criticisms is that it seems that the fact that the protagonist is an adult is something nominal because you never see it in his behavior.2) An exploitation without fear of the fact that the two couples were counted since the go. Within the few series that established the protagonists as a couple from the beginning or in the first exchange, not all the others are done afterwards and that is something that often ends up weighing.In some cases, the establishment itself is a liar because the classics are the parameters where a girl who looks promising for the protagonist arrives, but in reality there is nothing between them; in others, it is true that the couple establishes themselves, but then they delay it to show us basic things such as a date, a handshake and a kiss story.Fortunately, in Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii they had no qualms about showing us Narumi and Hirotaka, learning to be a couple at a logical and credible rhythm. Gentlemen, this is very important. If already with adolescents it is totally unreal to see them spend tons of episodes so they have the courage to hold hands; with adults that results in an abomination.It was wonderful to see both Momose and Nifuji grow as a couple through experiences, thanks to the support of their friends and especially to decisions taken as a result of maturity according to their age.On the other hand, the couple of Hanako and Tarou presented to the audience a very little-seen dynamic within the anime. Let's do a mental exercise, how many protagonic couples do you remember that for the beginning of the series they have been dating for years? And I do not mean those couples who live apart despite having years together. What's more, how many couples in the anime do you know that they have years together at the beginning of the series?At the most, you can tell me the parents of the protagonists or some adult couple over there; however, these couples mostly do not have any relevance except to be plot points at some moment (sometimes, not even that). Therefore, the case of Hanako and Tarou is almost unprecedented not only in romantic comedy but in anime in general.Obviously, that generated a lot of expectation because developing both characters was a challenge; however, after seeing the series it was clear that the execution was simply fantastic. Seeing Koyanagi and Kabakura it was easy to identify them with our own experiences or with those of people in our environment (whether otaku or not)And this is the great secret of this series. Its naturalness and realism in developing the plot and the characters generated that the audience could identify fully with everything that happened. Much more, when the otaku world was a main part of the setting.I do not want to reveal anything of the plot because those who have not seen this series deserve to be able to enjoy it without spoilers; But I will say that each of the situations shown was hilarious, very creative and extremely realistic.Finally, the references seen in the series were all great. First, because of the enormous quantity, but second, and more importantly, because of the creativity in making them. In addition, this posed an additional challenge for the audience because it was very difficult to identify them all.Is that within the opening itself is a great reference to musically, and that was already a statement of intent. Card Captor Sakura, Castlevania, Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, Evangelion, Mahou Tsukai no Yome, Asahi Super Dry beer, Mario Kart, Donkey Kong Country and Jo Jo, were just some of the works and / or products referenced in the anime. Even the acclaimed Japanese female theater company, Takarazuka Revue, was mentioned.Regarding the technical section, the animation was competent with pointed peaks and valleys, the design of characters was attractive within the generic; and the management did a great job adapting the original work.Regarding the soundtrack, it was interesting that they looked for themes that would remind us of video games because that complemented very well with the visual resources used; In addition, the opening ""Fiction"" interpreted by Sumika was a fun theme that brilliantly managed to get us into the environment to enjoy the series.In short, a great anime that did virtually everything right and whose only palpable flaw was to have only 11 episodes (although despite this it managed to cover almost everything that has been published in the manga). It was amazing how quickly it made its way and hopefully we can have a second season soon. Definitely, ""The King left the building"".SUMMARYWotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii came to show how to make a good romantic comedy anime without having to resort to the already insufferable formulas of the genre. 9.5/10.",wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii king rom com anime arrivedhonestly think thing could criticize wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii episode great seriesin first impression already said series could revelation season however must say wrong short series came fight top top best romantic comedy animewhen series good character daring establish plot manages create great fun script setting isable develop character without defined core plot show couple relationship realistically good soundtrack direction manages blend brilliant way fight topand leaving many point favor wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii wotakoi known community could added series lot reference work product anime manga cinema theater even advertisement anime hesitate start getgo two main couple already establishedin fact subvert legendary clich leading couple must established epilogue setting established hanako tarou dating together year beginning series happens overshadowed fact narumi hirotaka started dating right end first episodeof course necessary point argument come original material manga created fujita already couple perfectly built great merit yoshimasa hiraike directing anime writing script achieve excellent adaptationfrom saw series witnessed masterful development included several key aspect humor feel fresh natural gone formula forced scene sexual joke elementary school child exploitation child beginning genre false japanese haremand many could say protagonist adult however others also adult protagonist yet creator make behave worse teenager fact many series including several one main criticism seems fact protagonist adult something nominal never see behavior exploitation without fear fact two couple counted since go within series established protagonist couple beginning first exchange others done afterwards something often end weighingin case establishment liar classic parameter girl look promising protagonist arrives reality nothing others true couple establishes delay show u basic thing date handshake kiss storyfortunately wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii qualm showing u narumi hirotaka learning couple logical credible rhythm gentleman important already adolescent totally unreal see spend ton episode courage hold hand adult result abominationit wonderful see momose nifuji grow couple experience thanks support friend especially decision taken result maturity according ageon hand couple hanako tarou presented audience littleseen dynamic within anime let mental exercise many protagonic couple remember beginning series dating year mean couple live apart despite year together whats many couple anime know year together beginning seriesat tell parent protagonist adult couple however couple mostly relevance except plot point moment sometimes even therefore case hanako tarou almost unprecedented romantic comedy anime generalobviously generated lot expectation developing character challenge however seeing series clear execution simply fantastic seeing koyanagi kabakura easy identify experience people environment whether otaku notand great secret series naturalness realism developing plot character generated audience could identify fully everything happened much otaku world main part settingi want reveal anything plot seen series deserve able enjoy without spoiler say situation shown hilarious creative extremely realisticfinally reference seen series great first enormous quantity second importantly creativity making addition posed additional challenge audience difficult identify allis within opening great reference musically already statement intent card captor sakura castlevania dragon ball sailor moon evangelion mahou tsukai yome asahi super dry beer mario kart donkey kong country jo jo work product referenced anime even acclaimed japanese female theater company takarazuka revue mentionedregarding technical section animation competent pointed peak valley design character attractive within generic management great job adapting original workregarding soundtrack interesting looked theme would remind u video game complemented well visual resource used addition opening fiction interpreted sumika fun theme brilliantly managed get u environment enjoy seriesin short great anime virtually everything right whose palpable flaw episode although despite managed cover almost everything published manga amazing quickly made way hopefully second season soon definitely king left buildingsummarywotaku ni koi wa muzukashii came show make good romantic comedy anime without resort already insufferable formula genre,positive,0.28396659646659644,0.538518876018876
"Wotakoi asks its audience a question: ""Can you be an otaku and an adult at the same time?"" By the end of the series, the answer would be: ""Yes, with a little help from some friends"".The narrative starts with Momose Narumi as she hits the ground running for her first day at work. The reason? Her co-worker (and her ex) at her previous office discovered her true color as an otaku and the color spread like an unwanted seasonal stomach flu. Lucky for the misunderstood young woman, she would discover a brand new love (an otaku himself) and several new friends (more otaku) in her...brand new world. Nonetheless, it doesn't mean everyone can all go sleep soundly at night. Nope, they cannot.

Every character is relatable, every struggle is familiar, and every touching moment is well-deserved. Unfortunately, the art just cannot keep up with the emotional resonance of the anime. In fact, let me put out this question into our world as well: Why when it comes to comedy-oriented anime, the art tends to be under-cooked?

"A very good show for people who like romance anime, but with adult characters in a work place setting. The show is very relatable for adults in similar cirumstances. Unique story and the animation is quite good. The characters stand out as being unique. The show is realistic showing the mundane aspects of work life. I think others will like this show.

"Wotakoi. It hits differently. A softcore romantic realistic side portrayed through beautiful animation and its well crafted. If someone got a hard relationship and got heartbroken or something, they can literally tune in to the anime and it would make them smile.Mainly the plot is slow-paced and very small character development throughout the whole story. A slice of life. The fact I love about this anime is it's soo much light-hearted and really very cute. I can say it feels like the adult version of Horimiya at some point.I basically enjoyed it because I watched it after the STEINS GATE series, and you know...the pain right? I just can't think about anything but Makise Kurisu for a day. Then I started watching the first episode and ended up completing it without pausing.

"This romcom is one of the most unique plot i have ever seen in a anime. While in most cases you have a pritty standard story where there is a person trying to gain the affection of another person and the hurtles they need to overcome. This anime takes that standard plot line and throw it out the door for thier own unique approach on the topic. Because of that you have a really amazing romantic anime that is like no other!I highly recommend this anime, it was really well done and I have no complaints about how this was executed! The characters are super...interesting and the story keeps you entertained and caring for each of the characters.

"There is not enough anime on the adulting life. This is a wholesome and simple yet slightly realistic take on romance. Specifically for anyone in their mid to late 20s or early 30s, this is great for those in the grind of daily office life. No crazy cringe over the top drama or absurd mis-understandings. Just simplicity. It's so simple that is mirrors the day to day interactions of life. Some people want to escape reality and want over the top drama that doesn't remind them of the real life day to day. There's enough escapist anime.

"Boring and forgettable.I started watching in and watched to episode 9 to figure out I have already watched it like 5 years ago but totally forgot everything because it was boring.In this rom-com we see neither romance nor comedy.All jokes are around either nerds being awkward in normal life, nerds being awkward with other nerds when they need to do something normal and fights between the other couple.In first episode they decide to ""date"" and they occasionally hang out together like friends, playing games and going to drinks or anime cons together.On the stretch of 10 episodes absolutely nothing happens on romance front.They kinda...start to respect each other more. And this is the main point of all of this.Sit-com part is forced. I literally laughed once in 11 episodes.A bit of life the story gets with the tertiary character getting into relationship with another tertiary character not knowing that this is a girl. But nothing happens yet.In last episode the heroine cooks something in the apartment of the main hero for the first time. Before that she did not even know he has empty fridge 100% of the time.This.

"I'm pretty sure the majority of the hype for this anime is solely from the dance sequence in the OP. The synopsis says that the main couple starts dating because the guy offers, and Naru takes the deal. I understand that originally, she had no intention of dating him, but she does, and they are suppose to explore their awkward relationship, but there is BARELY any progress made. I am currently on episode 8 (?) of this show. When they have been dating for 7 episodes and 4 or 5 months in the universe, why is the girl still debating if she likes the guy?...It's so strange how she's still like ""He's not my type at all, but you know I had to compromise LOL."" after so many months? I don't know if there will be more development in the last 3 episodes but if there is, then the pacing would be HORRIBLE. Honestly, I'm watching out of the hope that it does end up that they have at least one scene where they are like ""I am so glad we are dating."" I also think it is strange how the main girls objectify their partners so much. ""It's otaku culture!"" No, it's just weird. And while I enjoy the secondary romance WAY more than the main one, I can't help but say that their banter is repetitive and annoying.",im pretty sure majority hype anime solely dance sequence op synopsis say main couple start dating guy offer naru take deal understand originally intention dating suppose explore awkward relationship barely progress made currently episode show dating episode month universe girl still debating like guyits strange shes still like he type know compromise lol many month dont know development last episode pacing would horrible honestly im watching hope end least one scene like glad dating also think strange main girl objectify partner much otaku culture weird enjoy secondary romance way main one cant help say banter repetitive annoying,positive,0.034374999999999996,0.5481481481481483
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Love is Hard for Otaku)Otaku being the equivalent of a gamer/anime lover.This anime delivers a pleasantly, comical experience through the intense emotions of the characters. This story is based upon Otaku gaining love, and holds true to the end of the story. That is the whole purpose of this story, and the characters achieve that through finding other Otaku to interact with, in this case being in the workplace. The characters kind of stumble upon each other and through a series of bold moves interact with each other for what would be described as an incredible experience.I guess life is...more fun when we gather the courage to do something crazy, eh?Four main characters are the bases of character development with a fifth/sixth joining temporarily along the way. Each character is given a distinct personality and have many flaws because of it. This is exciting, as we are all humans, and as well it's great to see the strengths of our characters in situations such as pissing off another character and then trying to make it up to them. Totally normal situation, ya?In fact, this whole anime is full of normal experiences and it's hilarious to see them back in action. We ourselves have probably been in many of these awkward situations or would like to be... how do I feel? How do they feel? What should we do next? Alright. Here I go! (being in the mindset of a guy interacting with a girl).Alright, ratings time:Story - 8 - In terms of a slice of life, this anime does a good job of building up the experience for the viewer and the main characters along the way. There is story progression.Graphics - 9 - Very modern and well done. There are even times when they incorporate an additional graphics engine to render games that they play within the anime itself. Super cool.Soundtrack - 8 - Nice to listen to. Fits the mood well.Characters personas - 8 - I felt that the characters expressed themselves very well and showed fault and strengths, and were consistent with their nature.Voice acting - 10 - Absolutely awesome Japanese voice acting. Really spot on and my favorite thing about this anime, if that can be said for voice acting.Overall - 8 - Lovely experience, that.Recommended - Yes, for all Otaku out there looking for love, or for ones with girlfriends now or more (you make me proud), and the two of you need something to watch together.",wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii love hard otakuotaku equivalent gameranime loverthis anime delivers pleasantly comical experience intense emotion character story based upon otaku gaining love hold true end story whole purpose story character achieve finding otaku interact case workplace character kind stumble upon series bold move interact would described incredible experiencei guess life ismore fun gather courage something crazy ehfour main character base character development fifthsixth joining temporarily along way character given distinct personality many flaw exciting human well great see strength character situation pissing another character trying make totally normal situation yain fact whole anime full normal experience hilarious see back action probably many awkward situation would like feel feel next alright go mindset guy interacting girlalright rating timestory term slice life anime good job building experience viewer main character along way story progressiongraphics modern well done even time incorporate additional graphic engine render game play within anime super coolsoundtrack nice listen fit mood wellcharacters persona felt character expressed well showed fault strength consistent naturevoice acting absolutely awesome japanese voice acting really spot favorite thing anime said voice actingoverall lovely experience thatrecommended yes otaku looking love one girlfriend make proud two need something watch together,positive,0.24600694444444446,0.5414930555555556
"Wotakoi exudes the refreshing confidence of a story that deals with working adults rather than high schoolers.  When dealing with amatory matters, Wotakoi is a damn sight more graceful and insightful than anime treatments of romance tend to be, the result of following characters with greater maturity, perspective, and experience than the standard oblivious teenagers.  Nonetheless, while it establishes its central relationships with frank efficiency, the show doesn’t always convey the depth and warmth in those relationships that would make the statement in the title resonate.  Love is hard for Love is Hard for Otaku.With the youngest of the four protagonists...being Narumi and Hirotaka at 26, Wotakoi’s quartet is comfortably lodged in adulthood already.  These characters are settled into their hobbies and are well-invested in them; Koyanagi has an established reputation as a cosplayer, and Narumi enjoys some success as a doujinshi creator.  They have inveterate tastes that they exhibit with the ease of people who have been otaku for the better part of two decades instead of just a couple of years, with Narumi functioning as the fujoshi, Hirotaka the gamer, Koyanagi the cosplayer, and Kabakura the guy who is deluded into thinking that he is comparatively normal but still loves Yuru Yuri at the age of 28.  They all have regular office jobs (the same one, apparently) and can financially support themselves and their extracurricular activities.  The lack of classrooms and uniforms and homework is, if only replaced by offices and business attire and overtime, a breath of fresh air.Koyanagi has a self-possessed coolness that frequently rings hollow in younger characters, Kabakura’s seniority grants him some measure of actual authority, and Narumi’s infectious fangirl passions can drive her into 18+ territory without, as we might find in high school anime, vague suspicions that this might be inappropriate content for the characters.  Even Hirotaka, a familiarly nondescript and inexpressive character, comes off as a purposeful recluse who does take note of himself and his environment to a greater degree than we might think, whereas a traditional high school context might have made him more of a caricature.  No one is safe from miscommunication, self-deception, oblivious behavior, and petty disputes, but Wotakoi’s characters can handle themselves and their issues more adroitly than the usual cast of inexperienced adolescents.In addition to the “adult” side of its characters, Wotakoi grasps the “otaku” side with understanding and aplomb usually absent from attempts to capture the quirks and feelings of a particular subculture in media (even if it’s that medium’s own subculture, there’s no guarantee of success).  The games that Narumi has to play to sniff out fellow otaku at work, Kabakura’s stubbornness in maintaining his preferential integrity, Hirotaka’s uncharacteristically playful text-speak with Narumi, the jarring gravity well of encountering a regular person after too much time in the esoteric hobbyist sun, and the freeing therapy of having friends around whom you can express your true self are all true-to-life by my reckoning, and the numerous scenarios pulled from everyday life as a nerd, as well as references to properties like Evangelion and Cardcaptor Sakura, demonstrate some firsthand knowledge and love on the part of the creator(s).  With each of the four leads representing a different subsubculture, as mentioned above, Wotakoi has plenty of opportunities to explore the habits and proclivities of its audience.Where Wotakoi falters is in its amorous aspects.  It’s true that Hirotaka and Narumi have excellent chemistry: they open up to each other right away and from then on become an inseparable and complementary duo.  Likewise, though Koyanagi and Kabakura launch into shouting matches at the drop of a hat, their underlying affection never evaporates.  What we don’t see are the big questions, the real fights, and the serious romance, which are only hinted at or glossed over in the show and need some presence if Wotakoi wants to distinguish itself as “Love is Hard for Otaku” instead of “Friendship is Easy for Otaku.”  The title of episode two asks, “Are We Now Dating?”, and that’s a question whose circumspect response only approaches closure at the end of the series.  In a pair of pairings that seem to have formed out of convenience – convenience for the characters, not for the story, which is a good thing – questions arise regarding the exact nature and future of these relationships.Love really IS hard for otaku: in the case of Koyanagi and Kabakura, each party has made compromises to maintain a relationship with someone who can put up with their hobbies, and in the case of Narumi and Hirotaka, the two seem to hang out because they support each other’s pursuits and can facilitate the other’s professional success, as if it were an expedient business practice (Hirotaka’s first-episode “confession” was certainly more of a business proposal than anything else).  Being part of such an active, obsessive subculture can make relating to outsiders difficult, or at least tiresome, so it’s not unrealistic that people would gravitate towards each other based on these superficial similarities.  Those connections make for great friendships, though not necessarily lasting relationships.  I wish that the characters displayed a bit more interest in each other as partners rather than pals.Koyanagi and Kabakura, a veteran couple whom we know have been dating for about a decade now, don’t have much problem being affectionate with each other, relatively speaking; we see Koyanagi stealing kisses, Kabakura making clumsy but well-meaning gestures, and the two of them spending a lot of time together in the quiet manner attributable to couples who feel at home simply doing nothing in the same place.  They’re clearly comfortable enough to trade vitriol when they’ve wheedled or casually insulted each other too much (with Koyanagi cutely shouting “BAKAKURA!”), and they know where to hit to make it hurt and how to placate the other side when it’s all over.  But the show passes up many opportunities to look beyond the surface level and explore what makes this a fundamentally stable, loving partnership.In episode 4, a distraught Koyanagi tearfully demands to know if Kabakura has “settled” for her; knowing that she isn't his “type,” she harbors doubts about whether their relationship has any firm foundation.  Showing her in such an uncharacteristically vulnerable state, Wotakoi proves itself willing to ditch its often contented perspective to dig into some problems unique to the premise.  Yet as Koyanagi breaks down, venting these insecurities that have apparently plagued her for a long time, Kabakura keeps his lips sealed.  He gently chastises her for causing a scene, essentially dismissing her frustrations as drunk talk – not that he’s mean to her, because he is clearly sympathetic, but he totally whiffs on demonstrating his love for his long-term girlfriend.  We don’t get the heart-to-heart where they express how they actually FEEL about each other.  We don’t see them acknowledge that they’re together because of mutual love, not just mutual pastimes.  Maybe the two of them have been through this before, but the audience hasn’t.  To let Koyanagi’s entreaties go unanswered is to leave us wondering if she has stumbled upon an unfortunate truth that sours the tone of the show.Narumi and Hirotaka have a different sort of relationship: one that leans toward platonic companionship.  We almost never see the two of them in any kind of romantic context; they’re always joined by Koyanagi and Kabakura, or they’re playing video games like they did as kids, or they’re sabotaging through their own awkwardness the rare personal moments they do find.  The shared interest in otaku culture, even broadly, is a big part of their chemistry – Narumi and Hirotaka can be themselves while they’re around each other, they understand each other’s peculiarities, and they can support each other’s dungeon crawling and Comiket preparations – and these things are very important, but where does the “love” in “Love is Hard for Otaku” come in?  Narumi might get jealous of Hirotaka’s popularity or flustered by his occasional forwardness, but such scenes feel like obligatory reactions, not reflective of Narumi personally; she did walk into this relationship unexpectedly, it’s true, so this might be a lot to ask, but I had hoped that an anime about adults would be a little less anime about everything.Hirotaka has been crushing on Narumi for years, as a few melancholy flashbacks establish, so his feelings are reasonably clear.  Narumi has a few affectionately shaded moments, but little to suggest that she returns Hirotaka’s feelings.  It feels like the two of them are masquerading as boyfriend and girlfriend because they each need someone to fill that role and they get along well, rather than because they’ve found legitimate life partners in each other.  Sure, that’s how some relationships are in real life, and that’s really how the first episode presents it, and it’s not as though a close friendship itself is insignificant – but I don’t want to watch a romantic comedy about people who will hang out for a while because they’re good company and go their separate ways once the fun has been had.  I want to see Hirotaka de-unrequite his love.  Narumi has found someone who accepts her for who she truly is, and now I want to see something greater come from that.  If we’re meant to believe that, however hard it may be, love – not brotherhood – between otaku is ultimately sustainable, I want to see evidence of a future in this relationship.  I want to hear one character say the words “I love you” to another.  I don’t think that’s too much to ask.  Hirotaka is 26 and he can’t hold his girlfriend’s hand.  Maybe this is set in high school after all.Still, Wotakoi does throw us a bone now and then.  The characters go on dates, they buy each other gifts, they spend quality time together, they acknowledge each other as girlfriend and boyfriend...  I wish that things could be clearer and more satisfying, but as I opened this review by saying, this show still has a serious leg up on most of its competition.  Overall, I’m thrilled with the easy companionship these characters have with each other and the fun that they share.Visually, Wotakoi has middling production values: generally good, with nothing that stands out as being egregiously under-animated; the episodes vary in quality and some scenes are just a little off-model or bare-bones.  Nothing matches the OP in terms of quality, though it is an unusually great OP, with some very fluid (and infectiously adorable) dance routines from the starring couples set to a cool, catchy, relaxing tune that matches the tone of the show.  The color scheme of pink, blue, green, and orange is a little weird at first, but it works well for the characters.In a cast that includes Miyuki Sawashiro, Tomokazu Sugita, and Yuuki Kaji, it’s Arisa Date who steals the spotlight as Narumi.  Her eccentric, spirited delivery spans all the rapid tonal shifts and quirky affectations that would be characteristic of an energetic girl like Narumi, especially when gushing about her passions to her close friends.  Taking a very close second is Aoi Yuuki, whose clipped, husky reading of Kou’s lines makes for the most painfully accurate expression of social anxiety I’ve seen this side of WataMote.  Kou is hands-down my favorite character and it is a true shame that she only gets introduced in the second-to-last episode.  I am ready for my three-cour spin-off anime about Kou’s daily life.  I want to see a Kou-On! that’s just about Kou sitting around, playing video games, and drinking tea.Overall, Wotakoi is a great series, and in spite of a few unengaging story lines, some potential for better production, and how long I’ve spent bemoaning what I perceive to be its shortcomings, it offers an all-too-rare alternative to the billions of cookie-cutter high school romance anime that for all intents and purposes characterize the medium of anime in its present form better than almost anything else.",wotakoi exudes refreshing confidence story deal working adult rather high schoolers

This review contains as little spoilers as it can,Story: 7/10Wotaku dosen't really have a deep story line (just ike every other rom-com) however it handles the theme really well. The story is properly paced and very much relatable to any adult otaku who tries his best to fit in with the society and his struggle to find other otakus who share the same tastes as him. The story however dosen't dig deep into the romance as much as...it should. Questions are raised on why otakus tend to date other otakus and I would like more such questions to be raised.The story has followed the manga without deviating till now.Art: 7/10Wotaku dosen't have any better art than the story needs. The art is pretty neat but could be better. Considering the art budget of a not very demanding series such as this, the art gets a 7.Sound: 7/10The music used in this series is mild just like it should be. The OST is good but would have played out better if it was a bit more catchy.Character: 9/10What I love about Wotaku are its characters. In a series such as this one, characters probably play the most important role. The manga has done a pretty good job on the characters which has been properly followed in the anime. The development of characters is a bit shallow but you can't really complain much about that in a comedy oriented rom-com.Enjoyment: 10/10I can't guarantee anyone reading this review the same 10/10 in this category. I have given a solid 10 here just because of the season in which it aired. In a season that contains some of the most anticipated series, Wotaku serves as relief from all the other heated story lines. Though there are two other series of the same caliber: Hinamatsuri and Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai, in my opinion Wotaku does it best. The series has me waiting for an episode every week.Wotaku is certainly the best rom-com this season and probably one my all time favourites. I rate this anime 8 out of 10 overall.Note:This is my first detailed review on MAL.

"It's okay.The timing on the jokes are a little off, feels like they couldn't quite translate the punchiness of the manga joke into the anime format. Definitely a romance before a comedy, and if you can't buy into the slightly over dramatic romance moments where the comedy takes a backseat, no amount of 'pretty okay' otaku jokes will drag you back in.The art is nice when it's nice, but definitely has 'don't look too closely when it's showing a far away shot' syndrome.

The character is told balancely alongside the story which makes the show even awesome.

"Romance generally boils down to one of two things: A shoujo or a shonen romance.  The two differ in both style and content with the latter of which being more varied in the sorts of topics (as well as being more perverted) than its twin sister.  But despite this, very few shows actually manage to pull off the 'relationship' part of a romance, a key aspect that these genres brush to the side in favor for an idealized relationship.  And that's precisely where Wotaku shines.Story:As a new employee, Momose Narumi finds herself getting a fresh start at a different company far away from the previous...place that she was at.  Unbeknownst to her, an old classmate of hers, Hirotaka Nifuji, works at the same company and the two rekindle their friendship.  But on one night of drinking, Momose reveals why she switched workplaces in the first place, leading Nifuji to ask her if she would be willing to date him.  A bit rocky, but hey, he's getting his feet wet.Mixing the lifestyle of an otaku by surrounding the characters in their interests and going to large events with the ins and outs of a budding relationship, Wotaku is an interesting example of how to do a romance relationship right.  None of the characters are portrayed as perfect beings as everyone comedically bickers with one another about various otaku-related topics, as well as poke at each other's shortcomings (most often their respective partners), making it so that even the slightest thing can potentially set something off and have the next five minutes be about a debate about which guy should be on top of the other.Because of this, the show consistently has something to keep the audience engaged, as the very tiny cast of characters get all of the available screentime and utilize that to their advantage by slowly polishing their characteristics and personalities that has them feel more like people than characters.  But the biggest reason why Wotaku deserves all of the praise it gets is because it portrays romance right.Relationships are messy, and hardly any if any are perfect.  We see this here as every episode puts its main couple to the test on what it means to really be in a relationship.  Things are awkward, usually someone has to put their foot forward first, and compromises have to be made.  For a comedic show that's based around four adults who drown themselves in anime, manga, and various games, it's surreal to think that out of every romance I've seen, this is the one that portrays the 'in a relationship' status the best.  With each episode, you see a gradual change with Momose and Hirotaka growing closer together, which is supplemented with the other main couple in the series having their own saga of a long-standing relationship and its problems/compromises that've had to be made.Despite having a cutesy and typically comedic exterior, Wotaku has a surprising amount of subtext behind its otaku-ridden exterior that makes it such a worthwhile romance to watch.  I will say that the ending really could've been put together more thoroughly cause it feels like A-1 just sorta said ""We're done.  It's ending here."" cause nothing really feels complete as the show just sorta...ends.  However the journey to said ending was very well-made and certainly one of the show's high points.Overview:+  Very real portrayal of a relationship+  Comedy mixed well with more serious aspects-  Show just kinda...ends.  Like a ball being dropped.Characters:There're only six total characters.  But in a way, you could argue that there's really only four that matter a whole lot, as they make up the show's two main couples and as such, let the show laser focus on the relationships that they spend the entire runtime building up and portraying.For Narumi Momose and her partner, Hirotaka Nifuji, we're treated to a budding relationship between two people who...don't really hit it off that well at first.  Which is honestly a first for me, as rather than a clear attraction between two individuals, it's just two people who decide they'd be an ok fit for each other and see how things go.  Momose is a (for the most part), comedically bipolar character who can turn her voice and emotion at the drop of a hat, and Hirotaka is the game addict who stays calm no matter the situation.  What we're privy to is two people who slowly fill in the roles of boyfriend and girlfriend while not really seeming like that in any stage in the show.  It's this strange mix that gives the characters their identity, an unpredictable phenomenon that's enjoyable to watch because the developments aren't so clear cut from the start.Koyanagi and Kabakura, the two other 'main' characters that make up the other couple act more as the 'experienced' duo, being in a steady relationship for years that seems to be rocky at times.  The two have dividing interests, as for example, one's a fan of yuri while the other is a yaoi fan (I'll leave you to guess who is who), and the two constantly fight and bicker over small things.  Personally I like this relationship more than the main couple as comparatively, these two are more interesting cause the potential to tell a story with two individuals that're in such an on and off relationship from wanting to spend time together to never wanting to do anything with the other in a matter of minutes is an interesting story plot that you often never see without it becoming overbearing or annoying.Overview:+ Small cast with a lot of time devoted to them-  Secondary couple by comparison is more interestingArt:Produced by A-1...yeah, you know what they're capable of.  Bearing bright colors that really stand out, Wotaku is a consistent piece that on an episode by episode basis, rarely disappoints.  As well as using a variety of comedic faces to transition characters' expressions from normal to exaggeration at an instant, there's actually not much to say about the art cause it's not TOO standout, but still looks good enough to be pleasing to the eye without really doing anything to be anything beyond that.Sound:Sumika's 'Fiction' is a cheerful, upbeat song that screams 'catchy'.  It doesn't really have any unique properties about it, yet somehow it's gripping enough to be one of those OP tracks that you really don't want to skip over.  Haica's 'Kimi no Tonari' has this similar attribute too, as it's a poppy song that really shouldn't have any standout qualities, yet has this air about it that makes it worth listening to.  I can't really put my finger on it, but for all intents and purposes, a 'It's good and worth listening to' should suffice.Personal Enjoyment:Wotaku interested me upon reading its synopsis and for sure was a show that didn't disappoint.  It actually gave me more than I had originally thought was possible for the show since it touched upon a lot of things in a relationship that never actually get the time of day in a typical romance.  Namely, what happens AFTER the confession.Sure we don't really get a confession in the first place, but the fact that the show spent pretty much all of its runtime on exploring the couples' relationships and the rockiness and baggage that comes with one already gives it an attribute that very few shows can claim to have.  Because of this, I really enjoyed the show, and the otaku-based comedy that came along with it because it felt fresh and no joke was really reused so everything felt like new material.If you're looking for a romance show that's more about the actual relationship than the crush and confession (which let's be honest, we're all kinda more or less tired of seeing by this point), Wotaku is the show that fits the bill.  It's a surprising contender that showed up in the Spring 2018 season that proved to be more than first meets the eye, and definitely a show that's worth the watch.",romance generally boil one two thing shoujo shonen romance two differ style content latter varied sort topic well

"""Isn't this a typical anime about otakus?"" Yes. And No.""Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii"" (or ""Wotakoi"" for short) is an anime that is more known for its shorts than it is for its story. In other words, it is a mix of a rom-com and a sitcom. Every episode has its own short story, and honestly, you could skip around episodes and still be fine. Thus, the story and art for this anime didn't need to be exceptional, but it's still good.However, ""Wotakoi"" was definitely enjoyable, and perhaps the reason I personally found it so enjoyable was that I immediately fell in love with the...4 main characters. They are funny to watch as they go on with their days. They are all unique in their own ways, despite their similarities.

If you want to know why, go and check it out :DWhat I did not like:- There was nothing I did not like, except for how short the series is. I know its because the anime has caught up with the manga, which is a pity I rather call it.Overall:I usually rate a series overall on how much I enjoyed it. Sometimes it might not have a wonderful story or life lessons etc, but I might still enjoy the prosess. Whats important is how much it got me engaged and the enjoyment.

"Last season it was net juu susume and this season its wotakoi. This feels amazing. When the main characters of a slice of life anime are adults, it would definitely be a good watch. Wotakoi does not disappoint. It is the best. We as anime watchers or gamer or cos-players or as manga readers are thrilled when there is an anime that focuses on our plight as who we are and what we like. Wotakoi is about two pairs of otaku couples who are slowly easing into a relationship when they already have common grounds. It makes us wonder what it is like when two...ppl strike up a conversation that both of them are comfortable with especially when the topic is familiar to them.The character line up is fantastic. There are narumi and Hanako who are both fujoishi and they battle out ships the way way we yaoi fans do. Then there are kabakura and hirotaka, the cute redhead who loves his manga and anime as much as the megane who cant stay away from his gaming console. There is also the extremely adorable naoya and his potential tomboy partner.Every episode is blush worthy. I love the kabakura-hinako couple more than hirotaka-narumi. The former is steadier with a long history while the latter is fumbling with their relationship goals. It is frustrating that hirotaka-narumi pair takes forever to make a move and we still dont see them kiss. That one time between kabakura and hinako is all we get.  Nevertheless its is adorable whether its narumi cooking for hirotaka or them going on a date and ending up taking about otaku stuff or even the constant banter of hinako and kabakura.

"One of the charming things about this comedic ""Slice of Life"" is that it appeals to a different generation by way of the age of the characters. Many popular shows feature 12~17 years old's (who are impossibly mature) to drive the plot; which is not inherently bad or surprising considering the consumer base for this and similar mediums of entertainment. The main characters here however are all late 20's and ""struggling"" with the fact that they don't really want to entirely grow up. Investing a lot of their time and money pursuing otherwise ""childish"" interests such as buying and playing computer games, reading/watching cartoons (manga/anime),...""dressing up"" (cosplay) and collecting dolls (figurines). This is the part that is relatable, being of similar age and also having similar interests/hobbies.I say ""struggling"" with quotations because their struggles aren't exactly complex or even necessarily that hard. They all work sufficiently paid jobs that afford them to live relatively normal and adequate lives and you couldn't honestly call them anything close to dysfunctional, the struggle is more about their social standing than anything else on account of the negative opinion of ""Otaku's"" in society at large. That being said, the relative tameness of their Otaku quirks/eccentricities does make them more broadly relatable. It would probably be more entertaining and deep in the long run to deal with less functional characters, but the wholesome-ness of the show is still rather pleasant and it wouldn't be fair to judge a show and it's end goal by something it may never have set out to achieve.There is a slight culture difference here where these struggles don't entirely translate to the West where there's not as much focus on work ethic (relatively speaking that is, i don't want to imply people in the West don't work hard; but Japan has a word specifically for people who work themselves to death (""Karoshi"")) and a much more liberal stance on sociological elements thanks to the evolution and spread of sub cultures that afford people today more freedom in their interests without as much judgement. So some impact might be lost on a non-Asian audience.For the most part though the show is just a general pleasure to watch with amusing and relatable gags based around how nerdy they are and at the age they are. The only things that are really feel out of place is how conveniently everything typically works out. There's no real sense of friction or resistance, with almost every challenge resolving almost as fast as it appears; that and the male protagonist is something of a Mary Sue. Being highly reliable, highly competent (despite how little effort he is shown putting in) and extremely attractive; with multiple scenes both inside the office work space and out in public of groups of girls swooning over him (much to the ignorance of the female lead). In a show that is largely exploiting Otaku stereotypes this is one they seem to have taken liberty with.The art is decent, with several amusing meta references to shows like JoJo's B.A. and Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji (along with some other name drops). The characters are so-so (but do feature some really good voice acting), being quite average, yet charmingly so in some ways. The show really becomes better than the sum of its otherwise remarkably average parts; but i should say that there is definitely some subjective bias involved in that conclusion.",one charming thing comedic slice life appeal different generation way age character many popular show feature year old impossibly mature drive plot inherently bad surprising considering consumer base similar medium entertainment main character however late struggling fact dont really want entirely grow investing lot time money pursuing otherwise childish interest buying playing computer game readingwatching cartoon mangaanimedressing cosplay collecting doll figurine part relatable similar age also similar interestshobbiesi say struggling quotation struggle arent exactly complex even necessarily hard work sufficiently paid job afford live relatively normal adequate life couldnt honestly call anything close dysfunctional struggle social standing anything else account negative opinion otakus society large said relative tameness otaku quirkseccentricities make broadly relatable would probably entertaining deep long run deal less functional character wholesomeness show still rather pleasant wouldnt fair judge show end goal something may never set achievethere slight culture difference struggle dont entirely translate west there much focus work ethic relatively speaking dont want imply people west dont work hard japan word specifically people work death karoshi much liberal stance sociological element thanks evolution spread sub culture afford people today freedom interest without much judgement impact might lost nonasian audiencefor part though show general pleasure watch amusing relatable gag based around nerdy age thing really feel place conveniently everything typically work there real sense friction resistance almost every challenge resolving almost fast appears male protagonist something mary sue highly reliable highly competent despite little effort shown putting extremely attractive multiple scene inside office work space public group girl swooning much ignorance female lead show largely exploiting otaku stereotype one seem taken liberty withthe art decent several amusing meta reference show like jojos ba gyakkyou burai kaiji along name drop character soso feature really good voice acting quite average yet charmingly way show really becomes better sum otherwise remarkably average part say definitely subjective bias involved conclusion,positive,0.12428478664192948,0.4537091836734694
"When I first went into this show, I went in fully expecting the most stereotypical of romance anime series filled with endlessly repeated character troupes and jokes constantly told. But hey, everybody is wrong sometimes!I was extremely pleasantly surprised by the pacing and humor of Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii. A tale about two people entering adulthood while embracing their embarrassing, childhood interests, while ALSO falling in love, brought forth a completely heart warming feeling. The romance skips the unnecessary fan service and keeps the relationships growth slow and steady, showing both the better and worse moments of it. This makes for one of the...most realistic romance anime I have personally seen so far, and is a large reason for why I enjoyed watching.The humor largely incorporates references to other anime or video games, which is super fitting for a show following two otakus, and in my opinion is very charming. I often found myself having to control the volume of my laughter when I was watching this at ungodly hours (no regrets though).I would most definitely recommend Wotaku ni Koi was Muzukashii to anybody who enjoys a quirky, colorful, and overall fun show, and is tired of seeing the main couple fall in love within the first 10 minutes of the show (as I am).Plus, the ""falls in love with childhood friend later in life"" story line is something I will never get tired of.",first went show went fully expecting stereotypical romance anime series filled endlessly repeated character troupe joke constantly told hey everybody wrong sometimesi extremely pleasantly surprised pacing humor wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii tale two people entering adulthood embracing embarrassing childhood interest also falling love brought forth completely heart warming feeling romance skip unnecessary fan service keep relationship growth slow steady showing better worse moment make one themost realistic romance anime personally seen far large reason enjoyed watchingthe humor largely incorporates reference anime video game super fitting show following two otakus opinion charming often found control volume laughter watching ungodly hour regret thoughi would definitely recommend wotaku ni koi muzukashii anybody enjoys quirky colorful overall fun show tired seeing main couple fall love within first minute show amplus fall love childhood friend later life story line something never get tired,positive,0.09018661518661518,0.5470398970398971
"When I picked up Wotakoi this season, I didn't expect much. It appeared to be just another rom-com to add to the old ""completed"" list. To my surprise, however, Wotakoi ended up flooring me for one, extremely simple reason: it made me laugh. I'm not talking about the amused exhale out of the nose that many forms of comedic entertainment usually elicit, but laugh out loud kind of amusement. In and of itself, that's an impressive feat. Wotakoi joins the company of shows like Konosuba and Inferno Cop, to name a couple, that have really made me laugh like that.Now, you'd have to look fairly...hard to find something that Wotakoi does specially or differently from other rom-coms, besides just doing it better than most. The main place Wotakoi excels is in its lack of dependence on relationship drama. Not once does it hang on the tried and true romantic tension for longer than a single episode, which is extremely refreshing for a genre that seems to be synonymous with drama fueled by miscommunication, jealousy, etc. That isn't to say that Wotakoi never uses such tactics, but the fact that it doesn't use them as crutches makes Wotakoi a cut above the rest.There are other positives to Wotakoi, of course, like its fantastically groovy opening, its small cast of lovable characters, each with very distinctive personalities and tastes, and, strangely enough, its hand animation. I'm not joking, Wotakoi's hand animation may be the best I've ever seen in any form of animation. Just watch the opening and pay attention to the character's hands. It's mindbogglingly good.That being said, Wotakoi isn't exactly the perfect anime. I mean, it's only 11 episodes. Who decided that was a good idea? More seriously, if you don't understand the references that Wotakoi makes, you may have a hard time appreciating some of the humor involved, which can detract from Wotakoi's accessibility.To be honest, there aren't many negatives to speak of regarding Wotakoi. It just won't be for everyone. Not everyone wants to watch a romantic comedy with far more comedy and slice of life than actual romance. And that's okay. Wotakoi can inhabit the nerdy rom-com niche and safely say that it does it best.",picked wotakoi season didnt expect much appeared another romcom add old completed list surprise however wotakoi ended flooring one extremely simple reason made laugh im talking amused exhale nose many form comedic entertainment usually elicit laugh loud kind amusement thats impressive feat wotakoi join company show like konosuba inferno cop name couple really made laugh like thatnow youd look fairlyhard find something wotakoi specially differently romcoms besides better main place wotakoi excels lack dependence relationship drama hang tried true romantic tension longer single episode extremely refreshing genre seems synonymous drama fueled miscommunication jealousy etc isnt say wotakoi never us tactic fact doesnt use crutch make wotakoi cut restthere positive wotakoi course like fantastically groovy opening small cast lovable character distinctive personality taste strangely enough hand animation im joking wotakois hand animation may best ive ever seen form animation watch opening pay attention character hand mindbogglingly goodthat said wotakoi isnt exactly perfect anime mean episode decided good idea seriously dont understand reference wotakoi make may hard time appreciating humor involved detract wotakois accessibilityto honest arent many negative speak regarding wotakoi wont everyone everyone want watch romantic comedy far comedy slice life actual romance thats okay wotakoi inhabit nerdy romcom niche safely say best,positive,0.261447653223969,0.4985802574618364
"- Finally my review of Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku, beginning with the story, which soon enough I notice that it is extremely simple but expected of a romantic comedy anime; the story is rather simple but interesting, since it is a work of romantic comedy focused on adults something difficult to find nowadays, in general, there is not much to say about the story, it is a simple story with a proposal different but interesting.- Now on the technical side, this is the weakest point of Wotakoi, the technical part leaves much to be desired mainly in its visual as a whole, even...for a romantic comedy; the animation is also very simple; the only thing that really stands out is the soundtrack; now about the direction, this is a complicated case, the direction in general is very weak also, although it manages to create a good scene of comedy from time to time, however surely the direction could have been better.- About the characters, all I have to say is that they are good characters, especially the protagonists, since the coadjuvants could certainly have been better developed, but the cast as a whole is yes very good, could have been better but still are good characters.- Conclusion, Wotakoi is a simple romantic comedy, but with a different proposal, has good characters, good story, but has an extremely weak technical part, as well as his direction; in general, I recommend yes Wotakoi, it is not the best romantic comedy of the spring season 2018, but still it is a good anime, I recommend it for sure !! 💛😉💙 !!- My favorite song by Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku 💛 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkGEOT7JhXw- My page about animes on facebook 💙 : https://www.facebook.com/pg/AnimeSpaceBR.050/posts/?ref=page_internal💛😉💙 !!",finally review wotakoi love hard otaku beginning story soon enough notice extremely simple expected romantic comedy anime story rather simple interesting since work romantic comedy focused adult something difficult find nowadays general much say story simple story proposal different interesting technical side weakest point wotakoi technical part leaf much desired mainly visual whole evenfor romantic comedy animation also simple thing really stand soundtrack direction complicated case direction general weak also although manages create good scene comedy time time however surely direction could better character say good character especially protagonist since coadjuvants could certainly better developed cast whole yes good could better still good character conclusion wotakoi simple romantic comedy different proposal good character good story extremely weak technical part well direction general recommend yes wotakoi best romantic comedy spring season still good anime recommend sure favorite song wotakoi love hard otaku httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvckgeotjhxw page anime facebook httpswwwfacebookcompganimespacebrpostsrefpageinternal,positive,0.18179012345679013,0.5092004703115817
"TL;DR: Otaku romance, with many otaku references / content. Close to no character / romance development though._______________While it was pretty entertaining to watch and very well done, I can still ""only"" give this anime a 8/10 score.That's for 2 reasons;- The characters basically don't develop at all. And neither does their romance. They get together in the first episode and it stays as that throughout the whole show. There are some romantic scenes between them, but overall they still act like two otaku-friends rather than a couple. It would've been great to at least see them grow closer over time. I would've expected more...character / romance development over time. I would even go that far that you could arbitrarily shuffle the episodes and you wouldn't notice a difference (apart from those introducing new characters of course).- The show doesn't have a real ending. I didn't know how many episodes it has while I watched it, so after watching the last episode I was pretty baffled.. ""wait.. that's it?"" No development in either of both couples, and the relationship between Nao and that otaku tomboy was left pretty much as is too. After all, the final episode could've just been an episode like any other.Even with those two huge flaws I still decided to rate it 8, as I can't deny that I enjoyed watching it a lot. It covers a lot of otaku stuff, as each character is an otaku in their way.",tldr otaku romance many otaku reference content close character romance development thoughwhile pretty entertaining watch well done still give anime scorethats reason character basically dont develop neither romance get together first episode stay throughout whole show romantic scene overall still act like two otakufriends rather couple wouldve great least see grow closer time wouldve expected morecharacter romance development time would even go far could arbitrarily shuffle episode wouldnt notice difference apart introducing new character course show doesnt real ending didnt know many episode watched watching last episode pretty baffled wait thats development either couple relationship nao otaku tomboy left pretty much final episode couldve episode like othereven two huge flaw still decided rate cant deny enjoyed watching lot cover lot otaku stuff character otaku way,positive,0.1971074380165289,0.568388429752066
"So far as of writing this I feel like this is less a romance anime and more a Otaku slice of life that just happens to be told from the view-point of 2 Otaku couples. I am using the term couples fairly lightly though since I feel like it's honestly closer to just 4 friends that just happen to be equal parts male and female and proclaim to be together when there's very little actual romance. So far I would say if you are looking for quality romance to probably look elsewhere, while this show does a very few really great moments, it's maybe 1...every 3.5 episodes so far.Basically I went in expecting a slow but gradual romantic development or even a off the bat relationship that slowly explores the ""afterwards"" of getting up the courage to pop that question. It's just not really there. The last 3 episodes in particular have been fairly bland with no real plot developement at all.The art style is pleasing and so is the sound. The Character's are all stereo-typical cardboard cut out's but at least they are done well.  The story started strong and held out for a bit but the last few episodes has me bored.If things change after the series is finished I will either change or delete this review. Not sure how many episodes are left but if it's a standard 12 episode anime I imagine the last 5 better be gushing with content or my score will fall lower.Edit: Finally finished this, and I have to say, the last 4 episodes had alot more romance packed in it but also tried to shoe horn in another trope couple and nothing at all got resolved or satisfied.TL;DR This is one big Commercial for the Manga/ Light Novel. The anime will leave you fealing unfulfilled other than some of the stellar moments.",far writing feel like less romance anime otaku slice life happens told viewpoint otaku couple using term couple fairly lightly though since feel like honestly closer friend happen equal part male female proclaim together there little actual romance far would say looking quality romance probably look elsewhere show really great moment maybe every episode farbasically went expecting slow gradual romantic development even bat relationship slowly explores afterwards getting courage pop question really last episode particular fairly bland real plot developement allthe art style pleasing sound character stereotypical cardboard cut out least done well story started strong held bit last episode boredif thing change series finished either change delete review sure many episode left standard episode anime imagine last better gushing content score fall loweredit finally finished say last episode alot romance packed also tried shoe horn another trope couple nothing got resolved satisfiedtldr one big commercial manga light novel anime leave fealing unfulfilled stellar moment,positive,0.09797619047619048,0.4296825396825397
"TLDR; Slice of life about adultsTo start off the bat, I was expecting an anime called ""Love is hard for Otaku"" to be about the trials and trepidation of finding love as an otaku. It's not. It's a slice of life collection of short stories about a pair of couples going about their everyday lives.That having been said, it's not the worse for it. Once you get around the fact that you were slightly misled it's a very enjoyable anime. The characters are spot on as realistic yet likeable people doing things which I would expect them to do (more or less, it is still...an anime!). Each episode effectively tells a different story from their lives and are mostly standalone, but still enjoyable.",tldr slice life adultsto start bat expecting anime called love hard otaku trial trepidation finding love otaku slice life collection short story pair couple going everyday livesthat said worse get around fact slightly misled enjoyable anime character spot realistic yet likeable people thing would expect less stillan anime episode effectively tell different story life mostly standalone still enjoyable,positive,0.14583333333333331,0.4934523809523808
"I'm gonna start off by saying I objectively consider this anime is good. However I did not truly enjoy it. I laughed and related to a few bits of the story and the characters. It's a nice slice of life overall.The anime does well to show how otakus experience relationships between each others. The main and secondary couples are fleshed out enough so that they don't feel generic. There are some tropes here and there but hey, tropes came originally from real life.If you'd like some harmless, mindless slice of life this is for you.However I disliked the lack of a sense of...direction, even though I know that this is not what it was made for.

"Wotakoi is a romcom focusing on nerds falling in love and having a nerdy lifestyle. It was a really enjoyable and cute anime to watch for me, I was never bored, and it was hilarious as well. It tells the story of Momose a girl transferring to a new company where she meets her childhood friend Hirotaka, they meet up later to catch up and Hirotaka suggest that he becomes her boyfriend so they can be happy being otakus forever, they also befriend the other nerdy couple Kabakura and Koyonagi.

"If you want a light romantic comedy with lots of funny moments, look no further! This show is entertaining as it is sweet and refreshing.I've browsed and watched through a few romcom shows, but this one feels most relatable and enjoyable to watch. From the scene taking place at a corporate office, to the portrayal of relationship, it doesn't feel forced and doesn't leave me feeling annoyed by the usual push-and-pull relationship dynamic.-----StoryThe story revolves around 4 characters (2 MCs, 2 supporting characters) who are supposedly working adults, and comes to no surprise, hardcore otakus! The main couple both find it hard to have a...relationship as an otaku, because either they devote their life to their hobbies, or because non-otaku are grossed out by the MC. The 4 characters also keep their hobbies a secret from their relatives and other friends, and fortunately they are able to find a safe haven in this newfound circle of friends.One of the strength of the story is that it is really simple, so it is very light and a great choice when you need a respite and a little laugh. They dont really tell the story outside of their little circle, so the focus is in the MCs at their workplace, doing their hobbies, and the relationship dynamic between them. During their work time, they do their job as usual, while sometimes making time for their hobbies during lunch or before work (playing games, watching anime, etc).  Several times in the story, they seem to interact with fellow coworkers and other people, and are seen as normal people and professional adult, showing that otakus are just like other people, only with high devotion to hobbies.How they stretch the interaction only between these 4 characters (while later on they introduce 2 more supporting characters) throughout the 11 episode is amazing. I never got bored watching them talking to each other, their friendly banters, heated arguments, and sweet moments.On the romance part, it is very PG-13 (they even only kissed once I think), not a lot of PDA, but nonetheless very adorable! It is quite realistic because it shows their lives very closely, so mundane relationship moments are to be expected. But, how they just let each other be themselves, enjoy each other's presence, no annoying miscommunication drama are a pleasant portrayal of a mature relationship. The romantic relationship between the MC seem to be transactional at first, with them only exchanging favors, but it develops slowly into a loving relationship throughout the end. I JUST NEED MORE FLUFFY CUTESY MOMENTS, PLEASE!As for plot, the series doesn't have any significant plot. The pilot episode pretty much gave the rough background story to start you off, and it has a few introductory episode to new character but it's also not substantial.-----CharacterAll of the characters have different characters and interest, so it is really fun watching them individually and their interaction with each other. They also have different focus of interest (gaming, manga, BL, etc). Sometimes their preferences clash, sometimes they agree, quite realistic portrayal of real-life interaction. In later episode, they introduce 2 more of supporting character, who also have their fair share of struggle to find relationship as otakus, and I guess would later on be a part of the otaku circle.There isn't much character development throughout the series. The development mostly show in the MCs' relationship as they slowly show how deeply they love the other. But character development isn't really necessary for this kind of story, I like how they keep things at its own pace. I just simply can't wait for the next season!-----ArtI think the art is very befitting of their genre and story. The characters' imagery suit their respective personality, enhanced with the talented voice actors who could perfectly match their voice with the characters. Since it's comedy, the characters are sometimes shown in chibi, or having a very funny expression to match the situation.The cute pastel-colored background and typical shoujo glittery effect are very suitable for each scene and amplify the cuteness of this anime! They sometimes use pixel bit textbox referenced from in RPG game, not holding back on the different type of otaku reference.-----Overall it is very enjoyable to watch. There's no significant up and down moment. The flow are kept relatively stable, it has its own way of doing ""awww"" moment without exaggeration, and it doesn't annoy you with a frustrating romance drama, making it pleasant and easy-to-digest.",want light romantic comedy lot funny moment look show entertaining sweet refreshingive browsed watched romcom show one feel relatable enjoyable watch scene taking place corporate office portrayal relationship doesnt feel forced doesnt leave feeling annoyed usual pushandpull relationship dynamicstorythe story revolves around character mc supporting character supposedly working adult come surprise hardcore otakus main couple find hard arelationship otaku either devote life hobby nonotaku grossed mc character also keep hobby secret relative friend fortunately able find safe newfound circle friendsone strength story really simple light great choice need respite little laugh dont really tell story outside little circle focus mc workplace hobby relationship dynamic work time job usual sometimes making time hobby lunch work playing game watching anime etc several time story seem interact fellow coworkers people seen normal people professional adult showing otakus like people high devotion hobbieshow stretch interaction character later introduce supporting character throughout episode amazing never got bored watching talking friendly banter heated argument sweet momentson romance part pg even kissed think lot pda nonetheless adorable quite realistic show life closely mundane relationship moment expected let enjoy others presence annoying miscommunication drama pleasant portrayal mature relationship romantic relationship mc seem transactional first exchanging favor develops slowly loving relationship throughout end need fluffy cutesy moment pleaseas plot series doesnt significant plot pilot episode pretty much gave rough background story start introductory episode new character also substantialcharacterall character different character interest really fun watching individually interaction also different focus interest gaming manga bl etc sometimes preference clash sometimes agree quite realistic portrayal reallife interaction later episode introduce supporting character also fair share struggle find relationship otakus guess would later part otaku circlethere isnt much character development throughout series development mostly show mc relationship slowly show deeply love character development isnt really necessary kind story like keep thing pace simply cant wait next seasonarti think art befitting genre story character imagery suit respective personality enhanced talented voice actor could perfectly match voice character since comedy character sometimes shown chibi funny expression match situationthe cute pastelcolored background typical shoujo glittery effect suitable scene amplify cuteness anime sometimes use pixel bit textbox referenced rpg game holding back different type otaku referenceoverall enjoyable watch there significant moment flow kept relatively stable way awww moment without exaggeration doesnt annoy frustrating romance drama making pleasant easytodigest,positive,0.1493114478114478,0.4969499759499757
"""Wotakoi: Love Is Hard For Otaku"" is a cutesy, somewhat random comedy-romance anime based on a group of adults trying to make their way in a tragic love life (meanwhile being an Otaku, whether it be game or anime). The whole gist of these comedic skits is to show what it'd be like to be haunted by your interests in the dating world, which if you think about it it's somewhat relatable. For an anime based upon this culture, I'd say it seals the deal quite perfectly and in turn, allows us to resonate within it. However, as someone who mainly watches romance anime, I'd...like to express that my expectations for this show were not met.The genres included in this anime, the main ones being romance and comedy, were extremely lacking. I found myself watching to find out where the story would go rather than watching because it was funny or remotely included said genres. I found the punchlines landed in some instances, then completely failed in others. To top it off, the amount of romance increased and decreased like a rollercoaster throughout the anime and even anti-climaxed when it would have fitted best.The characters would most likely be my favourite part of the show, as I was able to become excited at the appearance of a favourite character. Even though the anime was short, I can say that the characters stuck with me and made me wonder how they continued within the manga. Nevertheless, I disliked how the character's relationships developed more than the actual characters did. I found it being a repetitive quality that each character would have a singular moment of development, then immediately snap back to their previous state. It also became evident that character tropes were left unfinished or discontinued by the end of the anime.The soundtrack in this anime would have to be the least memorable part for me. When inquiring about this factor, I genuinely had to pull up the soundtrack and listen to it to give a decent outlook. From what I listened to, the music wasn't necessarily terrible but wasn't exactly fitting in the scenes it was used. Alongside this, for the life of me, I could not stand the small pieces of narration and the little noise that came along with it. It was incredibly irritating and jarred me every time it happened. Although, the opening for this anime is rather enjoyable and left my friends and I humming it for hours on end.Overall, would I recommend this to a friend? Unlikely, to be honest. While it was entertaining in moments, it didn't have the consistency a rom-com needs to stay afloat.

"This is one of my favorite anime for some reason. First of all, I love how the characters start dating in the first episode. You rarely see rom-com animes to jump straight into relationships. Usually, characters will have a crush and then drag on that feeling for the WHOLE season until we finally see them confess... BUT HOLD UP, something ALWAYS goes wrong like some dumbass side character or that the person somehow couldn't hear the confession over the fireworks OR SOME SHIT. I'm so done with that. The important part is not the confession or crushing. It's what comes AFTER. So I really love...how this anime concentrates more on the relationship itself. On top of that, the characters are adults that have jobs and hobbies rather than the typical high school anime series. You rarely see this perspective. This may be because many feel that romance and the ""fun"" all happen in high school. However, this anime shows that this isn't the case. I love these two parts of it and this might be why I've ended watching this series so many times and even bought the manga. It's refreshing to watch an anime that's both realistic (although you never really see such attractive otakus in real life) in the sense of having adult characters that work and also have healthy relationships (they may have some small ups and downs in the relationship, but these problems only strengthen the character's relationships with each other).

"This show is very true to the manga it is based on. It is a genuine slice of life anime that showcases the romantic relationship of two couples (maybe three if it gets another season). It doesn't have any petty jealousy that most romance shows have and focuses on the developing relationship of two childhood friends instead (with a ton of otaku references). I agree with Kabakura that Ranka is the best! (Macross F reference). Because it was fairly mature and not childish, I really enjoyed it. The studio also did a great job on their game graphics whenever they were shown! It made it...even more realistic to me. You will probably relate to a lot of things in this anime if you like games, anime, manga, collectibles, and more! I say give it a chance and then go read the manga. There is just one more volume that needs to be published in English (technically two, but they do two in one).",show true manga based genuine slice life anime showcase romantic relationship two couple maybe three get another season doesnt petty jealousy romance show focus developing relationship two childhood friend instead ton otaku reference agree kabakura ranka best macross f reference fairly mature childish really enjoyed studio also great job game graphic whenever shown made iteven realistic probably relate lot thing anime like game anime manga collectible say give chance go read manga one volume need published english technically two two one,positive,0.12111111111111113,0.4488888888888889
"Story: 6Art: 6Character: 4Enjoyment:3Overall:5I'm going to try keep this short so I'll just summarise why I  gave this the scores that I did.Story: The story is pretty average, it's just a romance between some otakus without any overdramatic crap that they have in most romance anime, also it's set in an office which isn't that common. but to sum it up,the main characters got together within 1 or 2 episodes, and by the end the relationship felt liked it hadn't progressed (also it's got the generic ""childhood friend"" cliche)....Art: Although it isn't something I'd personally like, it was actually pretty nice for the most part.Character: The characters kind of bothered me, they were pretty close to their 30's or something and yet they acted like ten year olds, which was already kind of annoying but the moments where they were actually acting their age just felt kind of awkward and forced.Enjoyment: I am not a fan of slice of life comedies, they always come off as bland and by the end it feels like the story has gotten nowhere, which was exactly the case with this show, but I don't tend to like slice of life in general (apart from a few exceptions).Overall I'd give it a 5, it isn't the worst but it's probably not something that I'd want to watch again, if you're into slice of life romcom's then I'd recommend this, but if you're like me then don't do this yourself ;-;, anyway that's all I had to say feel free to correct me if I got anything wrong.",story art character enjoymentoverallim going try keep short ill summarise gave score didstory story pretty average romance otakus without overdramatic crap romance anime also set office isnt common sum upthe main character got together within episode end relationship felt liked hadnt progressed also got generic childhood friend clicheart although isnt something id personally like actually pretty nice partcharacter character kind bothered pretty close something yet acted like ten year old already kind annoying moment actually acting age felt kind awkward forcedenjoyment fan slice life comedy always come bland end feel like story gotten nowhere exactly case show dont tend like slice life general apart exceptionsoverall id give isnt worst probably something id want watch youre slice life romcoms id recommend youre like dont anyway thats say feel free correct got anything wrong,negative,-0.0037037037037037112,0.6487654320987654
"Just wholesome and cute romcom between the four major characters. The two couples have different dynamics, and I enjoyed both of them. Besides being cute, there’s also constant comedy and jokes.Got introduced to more terms and places in Japan that I have never heard of before, which was pretty cool.The only downside is that there’s not a lot of drama going on. Because of this, there wasn’t much strong emotions in the journey of the main couple trying to learn to be a couple.But overall, I absolutely enjoyed the wholesomeness and comedy.

"Honestly, I wasn't sure what to think of this series at first as I read the first volume of the manga before deciding to head into the anime after hearing that it's more cohesive. The manga definitely did not blow me away and I ended up feeling kind of confused because it isn't very linear and jumps around a lot, so I was definitely underwhelmed heading into the anime. I was quickly absorbed though and the characters grew on me so much - this definitely translated better on screen for me as it followed a more linear storyline that linked different events together in a...more cohesive manner, and the humour really hit better to the point where I actually laughed out loud sometimes (which is very rare for me).

"This anime is damn entertaining with all of its ""otaku"" humors spilled all over the entire series. It is fun and relaxing to watch, just the right anime for the otakus who's looking for a non-emotional show. It doesn't have a progressive plot. Instead it portrays different situations in each episode, and that's where the progress start to show. But each of the episode's progression is not really unified for the whole series. It's purpose is to give laughter and relaxing time for the viewers. I'm a little bit dissapointed on the last two episodes, where a new character was introduced when the series is...already going to end. They could have played more with the situations they've given in the previous episodes with that new character. However, I guess they're just following the manga, if I'm not mistaken. But overall, the show is really cute and fun to watch.

"Wotakoi, in short, is an office rom-com about this girl who tries to hide her ""nerd"" (anime, manga, gaming [and yaoi]) lifestyle, gets found out then gets dumped, then gets a new job then starts dating her childhood friend who is a hardcore otaku. There isn't really any drama, there are some nice romance moments but it's ultimately lacking there given that they had to stick to the idea that the male mc is a hopeless otaku. Overall, the show is pretty much bang average really, but it does well enough in the comedy department to give it a 7 for me. One review on...the front page suggested the comedy was poor due to bad timing, and that honestly is a valid critique. Some jokes were kinda immature, poorly timed cringe, etc. But I found myself laughing out loud at least once per episode. Watch 1-2 episodes and if the comedy is up your alley, its a good indicator for the rest of the series. As for characters, the female mc is average, the male mc showed hints of development but they just squashed it in favor of punchlines which was kinda disappointing given they foreshadowed something serious just enough for me to believe it but don't be mistaken, this is no-drama, no-plot. Any drama is for the sake of comedy. Going back to the comedy, there were some really funny moments, for example the main mc and the deuteragonist are with their younger coworkers and they are lusting over two girls in the workplace which happens to be the girlfriends of the mc and his friend. Like I said, may or may not be funny, but I liked it and thought the show was easy and fun to watch, which goes a long way in my rating system. I thought romance wise, koyanagi and kabakura (green hair girl and orange hair guy) had better moments then the ""main"" characters (koyanagi and kabakura get so much screen time that they might as well be called mc's asw). In conclusion, Wotakoi has an specific target audience so if you like rom-coms and find the comedy to be up your alley, it's worth a watch without a doubt. 7/10",wotakoi short office romcom girl try hide nerd anime manga gaming yaoi lifestyle get found get dumped get new job start dating childhood friend hardcore otaku isnt really drama nice romance moment ultimately lacking given stick idea male mc hopeless otaku overall show pretty much bang average really well enough comedy department give one review onthe front page suggested comedy poor due bad timing honestly valid critique joke kinda immature poorly timed cringe etc found laughing loud least per episode watch episode comedy alley good indicator rest series character female mc average male mc showed hint development squashed favor punchlines kinda disappointing given foreshadowed something serious enough believe dont mistaken nodrama noplot drama sake comedy going back comedy really funny moment example main mc deuteragonist younger coworkers lusting two girl workplace happens girlfriend mc friend like said may may funny liked thought show easy fun watch go long way rating system thought romance wise koyanagi kabakura green hair girl orange hair guy better moment main character koyanagi kabakura get much screen time might well called mc asw conclusion wotakoi specific target audience like romcoms find comedy alley worth watch without doubt,positive,0.0820165945165945,0.47272727272727266
"Just kind of meh. I was watching for a romance and there were very few romantic moments. I enjoyed the slice of life elements revolving around otaku life and work life, however. This really shines when it does its slice of life thing rather than the romance.That said, when a slice of life is set up around two couples, you kind of have to review the romantic relationships involved so here we go:Narumi/Hirotaka relationship review:I love a good 'quiet guy, enthusiastic girl' relationship--this was that kind of relationship but it was not a good one.Hirotaka is like two steps away from hikkikomori, not because he...is afraid but because he is uninterested. But ultimately he knows what he wants and is able to vocalise it. He is quietly quirky with genuine emotions if you just. I really liked him.Meanwhile, Narumi was a bubbly energetic sort, likeable and sympathetic at first glance,  until you realise she doesn't seem to want to commit or look for anything deeper. She never seemed to be invested in the relationship, unless her desire to cook for Hirotaka in a later episode was meant to be a way of showing her feelings for him. But that was the extent of it. Mostly she seemed slightly possessive or just going through the motions. Whenever she looked out for him in vulnerable moments, there was never any actual depth of emotion beyond friendship expressed.I found myself watching and waiting for any crumb of affection she let drop for him. Not a very comfortable feeling while watching a romantic couple.The relationship was really stagnant and we didn't see anything really change or develop--no first kiss, the question of when they might have s*x etc... all really normal stuff that you go through with new relationships was just never addressed.The attitude to the relationship was, I'm paraphrasing Hirotaka here: 'let's go at a slow pace if that's what you need'. But the show never addressed why she might need that--prime opportunity for character development here, and we missed it. Is she vulnerable because of past relationships, does she have some kind of trauma? No hint of any kind of explanation. We're left to form one of our own, and in the absence of evidence, it comes off as she's unwilling to engage in the relationship physically or emotionally because she didn't really want to be with him, she just wanted *a* relationship.We got a lot of hints that Hirotaka really liked her since they were childhood friends, and no corresponding reveals from her that she might feel the same way.They were so distant from one another emotionally despite the fact that they were dating, that I found myself wondering just how much was implied because of cultural expectations on what it was appropriate to show in a non-explicit anime show... but come on, in a romance anime you expect to have a few moments where people break the boundaries of politeness among friends and work colleagues...Hirotaka deserves better imho and I hoped Narumi would turn into the kind of girlfriend he deserved. She didn't.Weirdly, and i'll note it here because i dont know where else to put it, Narumi was saved from becoming really unlikeable by the introduction of Hirotaka's younger brother Naoya. Naoyya was adorable and Narumi actually had some really cute platonic scenes with him, that made her more sympathetic again. It was just weird that she had those scenes with the brother of the guy she was dating, and not the guy she was actually dating.Kabakura/Hanakao relationship review:I love the kind of relationship where they are constantly finding excuses to fight over dumb stuff but then get really protective over one another. this was that kind of thing.The only downside was when two characters ( I think it was Narumi and Hanako?) were talking about how in some relationships people fight performatively but then are nicer to one another in private, so we're given to understand that that's the set-up. and then in the next episode or so, we see Hanako and Kabakura fighting while they're alone, which undermines that idea and makes you think maybe they're never happy.It seemed like that was a weird writing mis-step though, because ultimately H/K were way more real with one another and clearly more comfortable around one another than Narumi and Hirotaka are. Their fights are somewhat performative but they're still doing it because they like to do it. I also liked one particular interaction where Kabakura finally lets Hanakao drag him into BL and he gets super hooked, so I liked that he was able to take part in her interests and let go of his preconceptions.I don't know how to describe their comfortable silence other than that K/H felt like they were doing their own otaku hobbies next to each other in companionable silence because they actually wanted to be around one another, and N/H were doing their otaku hobbies next to each other because they wanted to do their hobbies. Where K/H were comfortable, N/H were awkard. i know the theme is that love is hard because otaku are awkward, but N/H never found a way past that awkwardness.All that said, while they were comfortable with one another, K/H really did fight an awful lot. I like a slap-slap-kiss dynamic but it was more like slap-slap-slap-slap-slap-kiss.Naoya/Kou relationship:A potential budding romance stemming from friendship and a gender misunderstanding. Kou is the closest person to an otaku and where Hirotaka is two steps away from hikkikomori, Kou is one step. Definitely could have been a really sweet romance story, had Kou not been introduced LITERALLY two episodes before the end of the series. As it is, we got a few hints of where the relationship could be going, but the series ended before these two side characters got a chance to become mains in their own right.Other notes:I also found it quite frustrating that the characters rarely ever said what they meant, they talked around the feelings they had about relationships in general a LOT, but there wasn't a lot of actual discussion about how they felt about the actual people they were in those relationships WITH. I know that's basically the hallmark of Japanese culture--but in real life you at least have the excuse of not actually knowing these people and it not being appropriate to ask. In fiction the whole point is to get to know more about a character's emotional depth. If we can't have it shown, can we at least have it told?One random thing that was refreshing is that there were very few contrived coincidences, silly misunderstandings, or people getting upset over nonsense. If someone misunderstood something or behaved stupidly the others couldn't help but find it funny.I've really kind of slammed this show in my review--i didn't really hate it--but it certainly wasn't set up to provide any cathartic moments and very few really sweet ones.It's definitely a slice of life show, not a romance, and it shines in episodes like the christmas one where Narumi sees Naoya wearing the santa suit. I'd be interested in reading the manga to see if it does the relationships any better.",kind meh watching romance romantic moment enjoyed slice life element revolving around otaku life work life however really shine slice life thing rather romancethat said slice life set around two couple kind review romantic relationship involved gonarumihirotaka relationship reviewi love good quiet guy enthusiastic girl relationshipthis kind relationship good onehirotaka like two step away hikkikomori heis afraid uninterested ultimately know want able vocalise quietly quirky genuine emotion really liked himmeanwhile narumi bubbly energetic sort likeable sympathetic first glance realise doesnt seem want commit look anything deeper never seemed invested relationship unless desire cook hirotaka later episode meant way showing feeling extent mostly seemed slightly possessive going motion whenever looked vulnerable moment never actual depth emotion beyond friendship expressedi found watching waiting crumb affection let drop comfortable feeling watching romantic couplethe relationship really stagnant didnt see anything really change developno first kiss question might sx etc really normal stuff go new relationship never addressedthe attitude relationship im paraphrasing hirotaka let go slow pace thats need show never addressed might need thatprime opportunity character development missed vulnerable past relationship kind trauma hint kind explanation left form one absence evidence come shes unwilling engage relationship physically emotionally didnt really want wanted relationshipwe got lot hint hirotaka really liked since childhood friend corresponding reveals might feel waythey distant one another emotionally despite fact dating found wondering much implied cultural expectation appropriate show nonexplicit anime show come romance anime expect moment people break boundary politeness among friend work colleagueshirotaka deserves better imho hoped narumi would turn kind girlfriend deserved didntweirdly ill note dont know else put narumi saved becoming really unlikeable introduction hirotakas younger brother naoya naoyya adorable narumi actually really cute platonic scene made sympathetic weird scene brother guy dating guy actually datingkabakurahanakao relationship reviewi love kind relationship constantly finding excuse fight dumb stuff get really protective one another kind thingthe downside two character think narumi hanako talking relationship people fight performatively nicer one another private given understand thats setup next episode see hanako kabakura fighting theyre alone undermines idea make think maybe theyre never happyit seemed like weird writing misstep though ultimately hk way real one another clearly comfortable around one another narumi hirotaka fight somewhat performative theyre still like also liked one particular interaction kabakura finally let hanakao drag bl get super hooked liked able take part interest let go preconceptionsi dont know describe comfortable silence kh felt like otaku hobby next companionable silence actually wanted around one another nh otaku hobby next wanted hobby kh comfortable nh awkard know theme love hard otaku awkward nh never found way past awkwardnessall said comfortable one another kh really fight awful lot like slapslapkiss dynamic like slapslapslapslapslapkissnaoyakou relationshipa potential budding romance stemming friendship gender misunderstanding kou closest person otaku hirotaka two step away hikkikomori kou one step definitely could really sweet romance story kou introduced literally two episode end series got hint relationship could going series ended two side character got chance become main rightother notesi also found quite frustrating character rarely ever said meant talked around feeling relationship general lot wasnt lot actual discussion felt actual people relationship know thats basically hallmark japanese culturebut real life least excuse actually knowing people appropriate ask fiction whole point get know character emotional depth cant shown least toldone random thing refreshing contrived coincidence silly misunderstanding people getting upset nonsense someone misunderstood something behaved stupidly others couldnt help find funnyive really kind slammed show reviewi didnt really hate itbut certainly wasnt set provide cathartic moment really sweet onesits definitely slice life show romance shine episode like christmas one narumi see naoya wearing santa suit id interested reading manga see relationship better,positive,0.12822343645514364,0.5429957237884064
"TL;DR, if you enjoyed reading the manga you will most likely enjoy watching the anime.The anime stays very faithful to the manga where the only real changes were changing the order of certain scenes to help episodes flow. Example of this are how two of the characters met taking place in the first episode instead of flashbacks later on like in the manga.The anime manages to capture the humor of the manga and, at least for me, it was great to see these characters come alive and off the page and onto my screen.I found the character dynamics cute and humorous. I think a part...I got a real kick out of was a scene where the characters shop for manga since it paralleled mine and my boyfriends manga shopping experiences recently.All that being said, I can see how someone who has not read the manga may not find enjoyment the anime. For me, part of the fun came from seeing the stories from the manga come to life with animation. Some of the stories don't translate all that well into an episodic format and some episode fell a bit flat and dragged on. I would highly recommend reading the manga before delving into the anime as I think you will gain more enjoyment from it that way.However if I had to recommend one or the other I would recommend the manga as I find the story is better enjoyed in a written format.The OP is a bop though, add it to your playlists.",tldr enjoyed reading manga likely enjoy watching animethe anime stay faithful manga real change changing order certain scene help episode flow example two character met taking place first episode instead flashback later like mangathe anime manages capture humor manga least great see character come alive page onto screeni found character dynamic cute humorous think parti got real kick scene character shop manga since paralleled mine boyfriend manga shopping experience recentlyall said see someone read manga may find enjoyment anime part fun came seeing story manga come life animation story dont translate well episodic format episode fell bit flat dragged would highly recommend reading manga delving anime think gain enjoyment wayhowever recommend one would recommend manga find story better enjoyed written formatthe op bop though add playlist,positive,0.25259398496240604,0.49928571428571433
"Hi everyone! I just finished watching the anime a few hours ago and right off the bat I can say that I adore it. Personally, I am not the biggest fan of Shojo, I usually enjoy the romance/slice of life genre through other things such as Asian dramas (cries in single). So I will be the first to say that this anime pleasantly surprised me!The characters are extremely fun and vibrant, you can't help but smile at your screen when watching them interact with each other. The voice actors truly did a great job bringing them to life. The setting of the story itself, given...that it is about four adults is also very refreshing because from my experience, these kinds of stories often only take place in high school.I have heard people criticizing the show for not really being all that romantic, or failing to be a good romance anime in general. I'd have to disagree with that. While it lacks the usual fan service or dramatic plot lines, it fully makes up for by providing an insight into romantic maturity. The fact that Nifuji and Momose are in love, and that Koyanagi and Kabakura are in love is obvious, it does not need to be shown through kissing, sex or contrived dialogue. They simply portray love in its unconditional and natural form. As an example, one of the biggest lessons this anime can teach any couple is that being with each other, sometimes means that sacrifices must be made. Throughout the show, Kabakura and Nifuji have to deal with Momose's and Koyanagi's obsession with yaoi. They let them enjoy what they want and sometimes do things that maybe they do not want to do themselves, but they still want to make them happy.Personally, I am not in to yaoi myself but this theme can really be applied to anything. We all have something we enjoy/are obsessed with, we might even feel ashamed about it at times. This anime shows that the right person, will embrace you, including the things you love, and accept you. Pure romantic maturity, I can not stress this enough.Also, can we please take a moment to appreciate how amazing Nifuji is? I feel like once you reach a certain age, you can see some flaws in romance anime or dramas and see how some of these relationships, while fun and entertaining to watch, can sometimes be very toxic and unhealthy if they happened IRL. Of course, not ALL of them are like this, but it is prevalent. What's great about this show is, that it has none of that toxicity! I am a 19-year old female, and I have never had a boyfriend before but if (by some miracle) I do in the future, I want him to be like Nifuji. So kind, comforting and compassionate. (all of this applies to Kabakura too btw, we stan)In short, this is a beautiful story, I am holding on to hope that we will get a season two because I need these characters in my life again.Thanks for reading :)p.s: we must protect Naoya at ALL COSTS",hi everyone finished watching anime hour ago right bat say adore personally biggest fan shojo usually enjoy romanceslice life genre thing asian drama cry single first say anime pleasantly surprised methe character extremely fun vibrant cant help smile screen watching interact voice actor truly great job bringing life setting story giventhat four adult also refreshing experience kind story often take place high schooli heard people criticizing show really romantic failing good romance anime general id disagree lack usual fan service dramatic plot line fully make providing insight romantic maturity fact nifuji momose love koyanagi kabakura love obvious need shown kissing sex contrived dialogue simply portray love unconditional natural form example one biggest lesson anime teach couple sometimes mean sacrifice must made throughout show kabakura nifuji deal momos koyanagis obsession yaoi let enjoy want sometimes thing maybe want still want make happypersonally yaoi theme really applied anything something enjoyare obsessed might even feel ashamed time anime show right person embrace including thing love accept pure romantic maturity stress enoughalso please take moment appreciate amazing nifuji feel like reach certain age see flaw romance anime drama see relationship fun entertaining watch sometimes toxic unhealthy happened irl course like prevalent whats great show none toxicity year old female never boyfriend miracle future want like nifuji kind comforting compassionate applies kabakura btw stanin short beautiful story holding hope get season two need character life againthanks reading p must protect naoya cost,positive,0.19602926587301586,0.5145858134920634
"Wotaku is a fun office slice-of-life that centers on the romantic relationships between four office workers who are also otakus.Each episode is well paced and able to hit the comedic moments. The romantic moments are also sweet and somewhat grounded to reality. What I liked about Wotaku's romance is that rather than focus on the pursuit of romance, it focuses on what comes after. What do the characters do as a couple? How do they maintain their relationship? The chemistries between the two pairs are also nice and funny. When things get serious, that chemistry strengthens and ends with a sense of levity. I...love the characters! They are so expressive and funny.The only nitpick I have with this show is that it ended so soon. Just when another romance began to bloom. I also want to see more office romance and the ending didn't feel like an ending.The animation and art are nice. The OP is addicting. The OST is great.Overall, watch Wotaku!

"You know when you see a meme online about a situation, and you find it relatable, but then you browse the comments and it's a bunch of people saying that it could never happen in real life?You start to think ""Wow, these people lives are boring/ they haven't live throught that yet""That is how I feel reading reviews about romance in MAL.But Wotakoi is worse. For Wotakoi is a seinen. Regardless of where it is serialized, it is a story based primarly on an adult perspective. So the relationships are naturally harder for younger folks to swallow. The perspectives in this show about work, love,...relationships and the world is one that you don't grasp that easily until you reach a certain point in your life. Unfortunately anime is a medium that is not segregated enough, and sometimes we just don't get it...Wotakoi does very well what it proposes to do as a slice of life.

"Wotakoi tries it best to cater to an audience still too in love with anime but are too busy with their 9-5 jobs. As the setting of the Anime, so is for the people it caters to.As I had mentioned, Wotakoi is an anime best suited for people who're although still obviously avid fans of Anime but can't make too much time because the Adult world is unforgiving and scary and bills, and bills, and bills. When you've got too much time OUT of your hand, Wotakoi is good enough to serve as little servings to just ease in. It's an anime that doesn't...demand a binge watch. And that's good. We've already too much to think about, in the end, an Anime is just a sweet escape that we all could need.The romance here is not as spicy as a Romeo and Juliet but just a little pinch of sugar just enough to satisfy, so don't expect heart wrenching, tear jerking moments happening anytime in the show. In fact, admittedly, the romance between the two MC, felt rushed, but as intended, since, the show was not about the happy ending but about what comes after that confession.What I do love about this anime is, forgive an old man for ranting, is that it reminds us that even Adults are still allowed a life outside their cubicles. That one can be a hardworking adult without giving too much of our lives away.I have nothing technical to say about the Anime, since, for the most part, that's already been for me by the other critiques here. But heed my advice, take every review here with a grain of salt. You should be the one to judge your own enjoyment. We're nothing more than just MAL users like you here.",wotakoi try best cater audience still love anime busy job setting anime people caters toas mentioned wotakoi anime best suited people whore although still obviously avid fan anime cant make much time adult world unforgiving scary bill bill bill youve got much time hand wotakoi good enough serve little serving ease anime doesntdemand binge watch thats good weve already much think end anime sweet escape could needthe romance spicy romeo juliet little pinch sugar enough satisfy dont expect heart wrenching tear jerking moment happening anytime show fact admittedly romance two mc felt rushed intended since show happy ending come confessionwhat love anime forgive old man ranting reminds u even adult still allowed life outside cubicle one hardworking adult without giving much life awayi nothing technical say anime since part thats already critique heed advice take every review grain salt one judge enjoyment nothing mal user like,positive,0.249,0.44
"The reason I watched this:  I watched this because it was a romance anime. The other reason is that it was popping up on my YouTube recommendation and I was liking the small clips I was seeing. The concepts of otaku in love made me want to check it out.Story:  The story is about 2 friends, Hirotaka and Narumi, meeting up in a company when they haven't seen each other since middle school. They are both otaku and basically based on circumstance you learn why she moved to the new company and at the same time you learn why they start dating. The...shows follow them and two other co-workers, Hanako and Tarou, life in the company and main focus is on Hirotaka and Narumi relationship.My Thoughts:  I'm a big sucker for romance, but what I really enjoyed were the hobbies that the characters were talking about were some of the things I like in real life. I also like the interaction between the two main character since it one cheery person and one kind of like no emotion like person. Yet the one with no emotion wants to release that emotion.Rating time:Plot: The plot, yet simple, is something I like. The environment where we are dealing with adults is a nice fresh of air here. The character being otaku is interesting twist. With that knowledge the common comedy they do with it is great. And the romance is part of the show which is awesome. The rest of it is kind of like a slice of life sort of. I mean they make progression but I enjoy it. 9/10Animation: The anime itself is not ecchi, except maybe for one or two scenes maybe, but overall animation is very nice. The anime is also new from the 2018. The animation shown for different emotions were done great, from cute moments to serious moments to I'm pissed moments lol. They bring in video game references (like RPG have attack escape) which I don't know if it under animation or not, but it cool. They also showed different animation when they were in a different environment. I think they did a really great job on it. 9.5 out of 10.Sound: I watch the anime in Japanese dub and I loved it. The voices were great for the character they were portraying. Even though music wasn't a thing even the opening theme was starting to get stuck in my head lol. Which is pretty big for something that not action pack I guess. I'll give it a 9 out of 10.Characters: The characters are all great. I love their introduction and how you figure out who is what and what do they specialize in. The character past sometimes looked at but not much. The progression is slowly there as well. Overall I would give it a 8 out of 10Overall with Bias: I really enjoyed the anime and the concept what got me. I think my bias is really strong here but oh well. I give this anime a 9 out of 10.Recommendation: I would recommend it. If you like romance and comedy and if you like the concept of otaku and that the character are adult that are working.",reason watched watched romance anime reason popping youtube recommendation liking small clip seeing concept otaku love made want check outstory story friend hirotaka narumi meeting company havent seen since middle school otaku basically based circumstance learn moved new company time learn start dating theshows follow two coworkers hanako tarou life company main focus hirotaka narumi relationshipmy thought im big sucker romance really enjoyed hobby character talking thing like real life also like interaction two main character since one cheery person one kind like emotion like person yet one emotion want release emotionrating timeplot plot yet simple something like environment dealing adult nice fresh air character otaku interesting twist knowledge common comedy great romance part show awesome rest kind like slice life sort mean make progression enjoy animation anime ecchi except maybe one two scene maybe overall animation nice anime also new animation shown different emotion done great cute moment serious moment im pissed moment lol bring video game reference like rpg attack escape dont know animation cool also showed different animation different environment think really great job sound watch anime japanese dub loved voice great character portraying even though music wasnt thing even opening theme starting get stuck head lol pretty big something action pack guess ill give character character great love introduction figure specialize character past sometimes looked much progression slowly well overall would give overall bias really enjoyed anime concept got think bias really strong oh well give anime recommendation would recommend like romance comedy like concept otaku character adult working,positive,0.24809929653679655,0.5351857220160793
"Hot damn, what a good anime.  Just finished my second run through it after about a year and feel like a review is necessary.  Firstly, I'm going to briefly mention what sets it apart from other anime of the same genre.1:  It doesn't take place in a learning institution of any kind.2:  All the characters are working adults.3:  Relationships are established in the first episode.4:  Basically no drama or tension whatsoever.I'm just going to stop there, they've basically committed every sin in the rom-com formula book by violating those 4 principles.  It's a breath of fresh air is...the point I'm trying to make.  Shouldn't be such a rare thing but it is and damn if I don't appreciate the **** out of it.This anime is adorable.  About 90% of the episodes ended with me grinning from ear-to-ear with my heart full of warm fuzzies.   This adorableness is largely due to the fact that this anime doesn't waste screen time on bogus drama and tragedy.  Don't get me wrong.  I like my bogus drama and tragedy.  But this anime says NO to it, Blue Submarine #6 style, and it's a wonderful, beautiful thing.  The focus of almost every episode is essentially to develop teh pre-established relationships.  Since there is no nonsense backstories or dramas to deal with, this anime is able to focus on comedy.  Maybe 2% of the entire anime is like backflash or some kind of explanation for something which is fucking awesome.  Which brings me to my next point of why this is the bees-knees.The characters...  They're grown ass adults and there is very little traditional ""character development"" to be had.  Screen time is dedicated mainly to involving these personas in interesting and fun situations, specifically geared to give you the giggles and the warm fuzzies.You know, I'm just going to stop this review here.  My only complaint about one of the best shows I've seen in awhile is that it was too short and had no conclusion or defining story arc, which honestly might be a good thing.  Definitely got my heart yearning, YEARNING FOR MORE, and I'll be reading the manga for sure.  -1 point for being too short.",hot damn good anime finished second run year feel like review necessary firstly im going briefly mention set apart anime genre doesnt take place learning institution kind character working adult relationship established first episode basically drama tension whatsoeverim going stop theyve basically committed every sin romcom formula book violating principle breath fresh air isthe point im trying make shouldnt rare thing damn dont appreciate itthis anime adorable episode ended grinning eartoear heart full warm fuzzies adorableness largely due fact anime doesnt waste screen time bogus drama tragedy dont get wrong like bogus drama tragedy anime say blue submarine style wonderful beautiful thing focus almost every episode essentially develop teh preestablished relationship since nonsense backstories drama deal anime able focus comedy maybe entire anime like backflash kind explanation something fucking awesome brings next point beeskneesthe character theyre grown as adult little traditional character development screen time dedicated mainly involving persona interesting fun situation specifically geared give giggle warm fuzziesyou know im going stop review complaint one best show ive seen awhile short conclusion defining story arc honestly might good thing definitely got heart yearning yearning ill reading manga sure point short,positive,0.2572420634920634,0.5523148148148149
"I was happy to watch an anime about and for grown-ups, but it's rather superficial, thus, a wee disappointing.The premise sounds good. It's the perfect anime for people who grew up watching anime and never gave up on their passion. Instead of a school, the setting is a company (though it's unknown what kind of company and who the boss is). Two Otakus who start dating each other, but somehow they never have their breakthrough moment. There's always this air of 'we're dating out of convenience because we're both otakus' and 'well, I do have feelings for her/him' combined with 'we know each other from...middle school'. Yes, both have feelings for each other but...nothing's ever happening. It is kind of a daily-life like 'acchi kocchi', 'lucky star' but for adults. It is entertaining and a good choice for a wee anime binge-watch marathon but I felt like something was missing. I hate to be the one to say it but I just kept feeling that it could've been better.",happy watch anime grownup rather superficial thus wee disappointingthe premise sound good perfect anime people grew watching anime never gave passion instead school setting company though unknown kind company bos two otakus start dating somehow never breakthrough moment there always air dating convenience otakus well feeling herhim combined know frommiddle school yes feeling butnothings ever happening kind dailylife like acchi kocchi lucky star adult entertaining good choice wee anime bingewatch marathon felt like something missing hate one say kept feeling couldve better,positive,0.36666666666666664,0.6630952380952381
"A couple of years ago, a drama called ""Nigeru wa Haji daga Yaku ni Tatsu"" (a translation of the Hungarian expression, ""Szégyen a futás, de hasznos"", or ""It's shameful to flee, but it has its uses""; the English title was ""The Full-Time Wife Escapist""), based on a manga by the same title, aired on Japanese television, and became an instant hit for its unorthodox perspective on love and relationships... oh yeah, and Gen Hoshino's ""Koi"" dance that took the Internet by storm.Why do I mention that? The male lead's performance in Wotakoi is a dead ringer for Hoshino's in the same drama: deadpan, at times...caught off guard, but very ""professional"" (even though Hoshino's character wasn't really an otaku). Additionally, the general musical style of the opening theme, ""Fiction"", was similar to Koi (without the erhu; the first five notes of the vocal melody are the same), and the ""seated selfie dance"" (that's why they're doing it one-armed, yo) was similar, if not directly inspired, by the choreography in Escapist. If I didn't know better, I'd say that this is almost a ""pakuri"".The premise has a similar feel as well-- in Escapist a perennial part-timer enters into a contract to be the male lead's wife purely to have a place to stay, and in Wotakoi a diehard fujoshi decides to go out with her gamer otaku friend from childhood largely to form an otaku alliance. Romantic intentions were minimal at the start in both shows.That's about where the similarities end. Naru and Hirotaka have fantastic chemistry from the get-go (and for that matter, Hanako and Taro... Oh no, I just realized the manga artist chose the Japanese equivalent of ""John and Jane Doe"" for the supporting characters' names >< ). Wotakoi is more of a ""what if a couple of otakus started going out"" sitcom rather than ""what if a man and woman marry as contractors"", and so the comedy and situations that evolve are very different.Naru's and Hirotaka's voice actors are unknown to me (I'm sure I've heard them elsewhere, I just don't recognize the names), but they deliver solid performances. The supporting couple is Tomokazu Sugita (well if it isn't Kyon Smith) and Miyuki ""Miyukichi"" Sawashiro. Last time I heard those voices together, they both were bit roles in a hilarious Charlotte scene. Sugita plays the irritable manga otaku office manager effectively, while Miyukichi's lovely alto is a perfect match for the cosplayer Hanako. The character designs are fairly standard fare, and Naru's/Taro's ever-changing facial expressions are some of the funnier running gags of the show.Later in the series we get to see Hirotaka's younger brother, Naoya, and a potential love interest, Ko. Unfortunately it's so late in the series that we'd need to wait for a second series/film before we see anything develop, and credit where it's due, they announced a series 2.A-1 Pictures' animation here is well-planned and executed, which makes me wonder why they accepted such a train wreck last season and slashed story quality in the process. I'm hearing a lot of harsh criticism of the studio itself, which leads me to believe they're just grabbing whatever productions as the lowest bidder. Sometimes it works, often times it's just asking for trouble. So for God's sake, A-1, do NOT use the same writing, production, and planning crew as Grancrest in series 2.

"I really enjoyed the change of pace this anime had, with it being older characters I could relate to them a bit more as they are between 26/28 and I am 24, I did enjoy the more in depth feeling of a relationship this anime gave whilst being light enough that you didn't really have to focus much on whats going on.Its a very easy going anime, the characters are likeable and i'm glad all 4 of them have their own unique nerdiness which means theres someone for everyone!It is still rather wild seeing the differences in cultures and relationships since our 2...main characters are sort of in that beginning stages of dating/relationships so hopefully its expanded more in Season 2!",really enjoyed change pace anime older character could relate bit enjoy depth feeling relationship anime gave whilst light enough didnt really focus much whats going onits easy going anime character likeable im glad unique nerdiness mean there someone everyoneit still rather wild seeing difference culture relationship since main character sort beginning stage datingrelationships hopefully expanded season,positive,0.24070512820512818,0.5682692307692307
"Relationships are always complicated, there is no easy way to deal with them, much less in a world that forces you to maintain a standard of behavior, because, like it or not, the social factor is always one that predisposes our actions to a greater or lesser extent. , which causes a certain mismatch with the things we do with what we really feel.This approach may sound too serious, and perhaps it is, but when you transfer it to such an endearing story, where you can feel identified with every detail, no matter how small, surrounded by an aura of tranquility, but at the same...time It encourages you to reflect on yourself, and rethink many ideas that you have probably had more than once, makes the whole process of learning about love and everything that it entails become even enjoyable.I don't want to sound too romantic, and I'm not trying to be poetic at all, it's just that Wotakoi is one of those series that invites you to enjoy life as it is, without regard, letting your true self out into the world, with the mentality of taking pride in what you are passionate about, as well as hope that there is surely someone out there who feels exactly like you and who is waiting for you, even if that person does not know it yet.Yes, it may be too idealistic a message, but it is one that gives you back a bit of that faith that many of us lost long ago; that gives us back that little shine that we were looking for a long time ago.The moment I started watching Wotakoi, I did it thinking that I would only watch a couple of chapters, but I was starting to do it and not being able to stop. I ended up watching the whole series in a single day, knowing that I cannot afford to do that kind of thing because my day does not give me to do everything I want, however, there was something in me that told me that I had to continue, and when I did, I couldn't be happier about that decision.This is a comedy series, but it has a deeper undertone, one that, as I said, keeps you expectant about the future, about ourselves, and about that special someone who will get to know us more than we do ourselves.It has moments for anyone to feel identified; Of course, this happens to give more variety to the comic gags that the series proposes, but it does not remain as simple, but that same proposal gives us to start thinking and reflecting on what kind of person we really are, and how we relate to the other people around us.At this point, we must be honest, the way we behave with others, whatever the environment, is different from our true ideals, those that are shown to be alone with our thoughts, and it is not a bad thing by itself, but the world, for better or for worse, does not allow us to stay alone forever, it practically repeats over and over again that we open ourselves up to others, and that we enjoy those little moments that are created with the randomness of putting people so different to live with each other.You never know where life will take you, one day you may be quietly reading your favorite book without any kind of responsibility, and the next you are going to work a 12-hour shift to pay the bills for the month; Maybe one day you are playing video games without thinking about anything in particular and the next you are waiting for the bus to go to an important exam, or one day you are simply reading this and the next you find yourself, in the most unexpected way possible, who will be the person who will accompany you until the last of your days enjoying your same hobbies as if that day would never end.I know that I am being very little objective, but Wotakoi is one of those stories that does not allow you to be objective, in fact, it makes you enjoy the complexity in the simplicity, and in how our environment, despite having changed throughout over the years, it can be seen from a perspective as unique as the first time, making you remember what it means to feel really happy, or giving you a reality check to make you feel fulfilled as if you had given back something that you did not know you were missing.This is more than a work of fiction, it is a statement of intent, and for anyone who sees it and can appreciate it, I am sure they will do it at the right time, the one where they need it most.",relationship always complicated easy way deal much less world force maintain standard behavior like social factor always one predisposes action greater lesser extent cause certain mismatch thing really feelthis approach may sound serious perhaps transfer endearing story feel identified every detail matter small surrounded aura tranquility sametime encourages reflect rethink many idea probably make whole process learning love everything entail become even enjoyablei dont want sound romantic im trying poetic wotakoi one series invite enjoy life without regard letting true self world mentality taking pride passionate well hope surely someone feel exactly like waiting even person know yetyes may idealistic message one give back bit faith many u lost long ago give u back little shine looking long time agothe moment started watching wotakoi thinking would watch couple chapter starting able stop ended watching whole series single day knowing afford kind thing day give everything want however something told continue couldnt happier decisionthis comedy series deeper undertone one said keep expectant future special someone get know u ourselvesit moment anyone feel identified course happens give variety comic gag series proposes remain simple proposal give u start thinking reflecting kind person really relate people around usat point must honest way behave others whatever environment different true ideal shown alone thought bad thing world better worse allow u stay alone forever practically repeat open others enjoy little moment created randomness putting people different live otheryou never know life take one day may quietly reading favorite book without kind responsibility next going work hour shift pay bill month maybe one day playing video game without thinking anything particular next waiting bus go important exam one day simply reading next find unexpected way possible person accompany last day enjoying hobby day would never endi know little objective wotakoi one story allow objective fact make enjoy complexity simplicity environment despite changed throughout year seen perspective unique first time making remember mean feel really happy giving reality check make feel fulfilled given back something know missingthis work fiction statement intent anyone see appreciate sure right time one need,positive,0.1643090032330539,0.4928998392605988
"Looking for some filler that won't mess with your feelings from that last show you really liked but will give you something to enjoy a bit? Jackpot!!!This one and Net-Juu no Susume both looked similar on my list and I expected something similar out of both. However, Net-Juu was the show I wanted, it had heart, soul, a cutesy story and left a strong, fun, meaningful impression despite its content. Wotaku was about what I expected by the cover art, but I was still hoping for more.The key with this one is enjoying it for what it is without reading to much into the...reality of it. Or if you like to analyze and contemplate things deeply, then the key is to do the exact opposite, but be warned if this is the kind of life you seek, there is no profundity explored in this one, or rather, there is no profundity TO explore.The empty philosophy of the show is pretty sad the more you think about it, so it will really depend on your relation to the characters and your closet-sort-of-otaku level. If you're really diving into deep support of anime and characters, finding your life's meaning in digital self indulgence and merchandise consumption, then this one will leave you feeling justified! Did that line make you happy? If not, you will feel about like you just did while watching this.To be fair, I really liked Nao and that shy character and frankly I thought that was better than the entire rest of the story.The characters are like really composed and pretty versions of those kids who seem a bit lost in fantasy worlds and who generally can't hold regular conversations. I think a lot of people here will have those they have trouble talking to for lack of skill, comfort, or common ground. However, anytime I've met people like this in real life, they were decidedly less amiable. If you tried to game with them they CRUSHED you mercilessly without regard, if you tried to talk to them they could ONLY talk about what they were extremely into at the moment. It seemed like these were the kinds of people the show tried to convey, but I've met them as adults and they aren't like this. At the same time, as a closet nerd for this and that I couldn't relate either. It expected too much of me: I couldn't both suspend my philosophy of life meaning while also trying to accept this fashionable 'otaku' representation as something legitimate.Its one thing to be really into things, its another to be a composed adult, and still another to develop a life of real meaning. Sure they can all relate and intertwine, but the show has this unwritten vibe that a life devoid of meaning is somehow fine and normal. Like these characters NEVER wen't to sleep wondering what the meaning of their life was, if they were wasting their time, if it was all worth it. That whole reality is completely ejected, it just doesn't exist in this world, and thats pretty sad to watch. They never find meaning either, they just sort of team up to indulge their fancies and then thats supposed to be satisfying.I guess my problem with this show is how non-self-aware it is. It really buys its own schtick. The interactions were fun and the show had many laughable moments but the authors apparent lack of understanding regarding why life has meaning and what is actually real and worth pursuing cast a dim tone on it. Naturally those who derive their entire identity and sense of worth from this kind of materialistic meandering might be breathing fire at this point, but thats just it. The void that they are trying to fill that yields the fire breathing upon challenging their worldview is what is missing from this show - I guess you could say its like its soul is gone. Its one thing to get passionate about being a nerd and to talk about the difficulties associating with 'normies' but thats a pretty 'small' plot.Getting along with people who can't relate to your interests or world is difficult, for 12 episodes. I get it, I've experienced it, I still do, this is not the be-all and end-all of life's meaning. The fact that absolutely NOTHING else is ever explored leaves this one in an odd and highly forgettable, if mildly amusing spot. Compare this to something like Yuru Camp which is up to its eyeballs in heart and soul while exploring simple life events and it gives a clear picture of this shows value or lack thereof.",looking filler wont mess feeling last show really liked give something enjoy bit jackpotthis one netjuu susume looked similar list expected something similar however netjuu show wanted heart soul cutesy story left strong fun meaningful impression despite content wotaku expected cover art still hoping morethe key one enjoying without reading much thereality like analyze contemplate thing deeply key exact opposite warned kind life seek profundity explored one rather profundity explorethe empty philosophy show pretty sad think really depend relation character closetsortofotaku level youre really diving deep support anime character finding life meaning digital self indulgence merchandise consumption one leave feeling justified line make happy feel like watching thisto fair really liked nao shy character frankly thought better entire rest storythe character like really composed pretty version kid seem bit lost fantasy world generally cant hold regular conversation think lot people trouble talking lack skill comfort common ground however anytime ive met people like real life decidedly less amiable tried game crushed mercilessly without regard tried talk could talk extremely moment seemed like kind people show tried convey ive met adult arent like time closet nerd couldnt relate either expected much couldnt suspend philosophy life meaning also trying accept fashionable otaku representation something legitimateits one thing really thing another composed adult still another develop life real meaning sure relate intertwine show unwritten vibe life devoid meaning somehow fine normal like character never went sleep wondering meaning life wasting time worth whole reality completely ejected doesnt exist world thats pretty sad watch never find meaning either sort team indulge fancy thats supposed satisfyingi guess problem show nonselfaware really buy schtick interaction fun show many laughable moment author apparent lack understanding regarding life meaning actually real worth pursuing cast dim tone naturally derive entire identity sense worth kind materialistic meandering might breathing fire point thats void trying fill yield fire breathing upon challenging worldview missing show guess could say like soul gone one thing get passionate nerd talk difficulty associating normies thats pretty small plotgetting along people cant relate interest world difficult episode get ive experienced still beall endall life meaning fact absolutely nothing else ever explored leaf one odd highly forgettable mildly amusing spot compare something like yuru camp eyeball heart soul exploring simple life event give clear picture show value lack thereof,positive,0.11960784313725492,0.5135053508582919

"There is very little to criticize about this anime at all except that I wish it were a little longer.To begin with, the story is amazing. It's a romance, but it's not one of those shoujo schoolgirl romances with unnecessary blushfests, multiple misunderstandings, and 'romantic' touches nearing sexual assault. This is a tasteful romance that also forgoes the excessive passion in more erotic and sensual romantic anime/manga where the love is so bright and strong that it's hard to believe it can last like that for any time at all. Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a story about two adult couples with quiet,...mundane love stories. It is responsible, plausible, understated, and strong that gains support in the couple sharing ground and understanding of each other instead of seeking to change each other-- it's a romance of normal people who are just happy the way they are. It's so rare to find such a realistic, mature romantic anime, and I'm so glad that I did. Especially since the plot has so many comedy and otaku elements-- being a certified fangirl, shipper, BL chick, otaku, and otome geek, I enjoyed all the references and found this to be refreshing and so enjoyable I could barely wait for the episode each week.The art was phenomenal. Without making anything overly unrealistic (massive bouncing jello boobs for the chicks, sexy abs when the guys barely even work out, etc.) it just fit into a mundane, every day artstyle. It was clean, colorful, and  was very appealing to the eye. Not to mention the clothing designs (especially for Narumi) were quite adorable! They did a great job with her hair and a lot of the details.I didn't love the opening at first, but it really grew on me, as did the closing. They're not perfect songs or songs I would listen to on my own time, but whenever I hear the first few notes, I will immediately remember the adorable anime this was. :)As mentioned before, the characters were amazing since they were in this mature, realistic romance. They retained enough faults (being addicted to BL/boobs, being angry little jerks, being teases for no good reason, being annoying drunks, getting mad for no good reason, etc.) to seem human, while also being good at things they did. They really seemed like real people, which was pretty great.Overall, this was such a wholesome anime that I just adore it with all my heart. :) I'm praying there's gonna be more of it!I would recommend this if you: like mature romances, like quiet romances without a lot of action, like Kiss Him Not Me, love otaku humorI would NOT recommend this if you: like more 'passionate' romances, like the traditional shoujo romances, can't stand it if the main ship isn't making out most of the time, otaku humor isn't really your favoriteHave great day everyone!",little criticize anime except wish little longerto begin story amazing romance one shoujo schoolgirl romance unnecessary blushfests multiple misunderstanding romantic touch nearing sexual assault tasteful romance also forgoes excessive passion erotic sensual romantic animemanga love bright strong hard believe last like time wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii story two adult couple quietmundane love story responsible plausible understated strong gain support couple sharing ground understanding instead seeking change romance normal people happy way rare find realistic mature romantic anime im glad especially since plot many comedy otaku element certified fangirl shipper bl chick otaku otome geek enjoyed reference found refreshing enjoyable could barely wait episode weekthe art phenomenal without making anything overly unrealistic massive bouncing jello boob chick sexy ab guy barely even work etc fit mundane every day artstyle clean colorful appealing eye mention clothing design especially narumi quite adorable great job hair lot detailsi didnt love opening first really grew closing theyre perfect song song would listen time whenever hear first note immediately remember adorable anime mentioned character amazing since mature realistic romance retained enough fault addicted blboobs angry little jerk tease good reason annoying drunk getting mad good reason etc seem human also good thing really seemed like real people pretty greatoverall wholesome anime adore heart im praying there gon na iti would recommend like mature romance like quiet romance without lot action like kiss love otaku humori would recommend like passionate romance like traditional shoujo romance cant stand main ship isnt making time otaku humor isnt really favoritehave great day everyone,positive,0.2088141025641025,0.5971153846153849
"Wotakoi is a different kind of romantic comedy show. Most modern romantic comedy shows tend to portray teenagers acting out the many tropes we see in today's stories. The overactive tsundere, the clumsy, well-endowed girl, the male who can't help but stutter around pretty girls due to their inexperience, etc. This show doesn't follow the rom-com playbook. It throws it out the window and completely redefines what the genre can be. It was really enjoyable.Story:The story was very mature. It follows a couple of otaku friends who reunite at their place of work and end up dating. They soon make friends with another otaku couple,...and then the show really hits its stride. This is where the magic happens. The show explores not only the awkward situations that come with being a new couple, but also the awkwardness of sharing a hobby that is shunned by some with others.Art:The art was pretty standard. Nothing too over the top, but definitely precise and on point.Sound:The music wasn't very standout either. It did a good job of adding to the story without actually drawing attention to itself.Character:Easily the best part of the show. The maturity the characters showed was something you just don't see from romantic comedies in anime. The main couple, Narumi and Hirotaka, were really interesting. They took things slowly and grow their relationship in an organic way as they spend more time with each other. Narumi has similar traits to many female protagonists I've seen, but Hirotaka's chill demeanor is different.The other couple, Hanako and Taro, does a great job of helping them along while also continuing along the difficult path of managing their own relationship. This dynamic felt authentic. It was something that comes with having older characters.Enjoyment:I found myself really enjoying this show more than I thought. I can be a little skeptical of romantic comedy anime, but this show gave me hope for the genre. It was funny when it needed to be, and more serious when necessary.Overall:Definitely one of the better rom-coms in modern times. I would absolutely recommend this show to anyone who wants a more mature, realistic take on relationships",wotakoi different kind romantic comedy show modern romantic comedy show tend portray teenager acting many trope see today story overactive tsundere clumsy wellendowed girl male cant help stutter around pretty girl due inexperience etc show doesnt follow romcom playbook throw window completely redefines genre really enjoyablestorythe story mature follows couple otaku friend reunite place work end dating soon make friend another otaku coupleand show really hit stride magic happens show explores awkward situation come new couple also awkwardness sharing hobby shunned othersartthe art pretty standard nothing top definitely precise pointsoundthe music wasnt standout either good job adding story without actually drawing attention itselfcharactereasily best part show maturity character showed something dont see romantic comedy anime main couple narumi hirotaka really interesting took thing slowly grow relationship organic way spend time narumi similar trait many female protagonist ive seen hirotakas chill demeanor differentthe couple hanako taro great job helping along also continuing along difficult path managing relationship dynamic felt authentic something come older charactersenjoymenti found really enjoying show thought little skeptical romantic comedy anime show gave hope genre funny needed serious necessaryoveralldefinitely one better romcoms modern time would absolutely recommend show anyone want mature realistic take relationship,positive,0.15292771464646468,0.4901988636363637
"This was without a single doubt my favorite anime this season. It helps that this was my most anticipated anime of the season. It ALSO helps that I’m caught up on the manga and already love the series. From beginning to end, this was an extremely fun and lovable anime. It was also an amazingly accurate adaptation.Wotakoi follows four adults all working in the same office. All of them happen to be Otaku. Hirotaka is a gaming Otaku, Narumi is a manga/anime Otaku, Kabakura is a manga Otaku, and Koyanagi is Cosplay/BL Otaku. As it turns out, Kabakura and Koyanagi have been dating for...quite some time. Hirotaka and Narumi are actually childhood friends, but haven’t seen each other in years. Soon, they start to date as well.Wotakoi is a romance/slice of life that follows actual working adults. All of these characters are in their 20’s and some have prior dating knowledge. Due to this, there are almost NONE of the common romance troupes. There are no misunderstandings, miscommunications, love triangles, harems, dumb decisions, or anything like that. These are all adults, not drama filled high school students. This was a breath of fresh air. It still manages to be wholesome and adorable as hell at times. Since all of the cast are Otaku, viewers are treated to some genuine Otaku conversations and activities. You can tell they’ve been Otaku for years now and it’s just natural for them at this point. There are a few instances of drama, but even that feels fresh. When two Otaku start to date, they start to wonder if they really do like each other or if one (or both) of them are simply making a compromise with dating someone with similar interests because it’d be easier. I love how a few episodes play with this dynamic and address it appropriately. Since the characters are all adults, they actually stop to talk about this with their partner instead of keeping it bottled inside.The humor is too notch in Wotakoi. While there are plenty of anime, manga, and video game references, the anime doesn’t rely solely on them to be funny. I can appreciate the fact that the references can be noticed by all sorts of anime fans. It’s not limited to certain genres or years.The main things holding back Wotakoi however are all production related. The animation isn’t all that good, but it’s not bad either. It’s somewhere between “Good” and “Adequate.” The soundtrack kind of gets repetitive with the same 2-3 background tracks always playing. At least the OP and ED are phenomenal. This is a critique/comment from someone who’s a huge fan of the manga, but I would’ve loved to see the anime take more chances with anime-only material. It would’ve been nice to see if the studio could make their own moments with the same character dynamics and humor as the manga material. Either way, Wotakoi was truly a gem to watch. I might rewatch it at some point this summer just because of how enjoyable it was. Without a doubt, I’ll be playing the opening theme at least 4 times a week.(Side Note: I doubt we’ll be getting a 2nd season anytime soon. Maybe 3 years from now. The anime basically covered all of the manga chapters. It started relatively recently and it’s a monthly updated manga, so there’s not a lot of material out thus far and it’ll be awhile before enough material for a 2nd season is available.)",without single doubt favorite anime season help anticipated anime season also help im caught manga already love series beginning end extremely fun lovable anime also amazingly accurate adaptationwotakoi follows four adult working office happen otaku hirotaka gaming otaku narumi mangaanime otaku kabakura manga otaku koyanagi cosplaybl otaku turn kabakura koyanagi dating forquite time hirotaka narumi actually childhood friend havent seen year soon start date wellwotakoi romanceslice life follows actual working adult character prior dating knowledge due almost none common romance troupe misunderstanding miscommunications love triangle harem dumb decision anything like adult drama filled high school student breath fresh air still manages wholesome adorable hell time since cast otaku viewer treated genuine otaku conversation activity tell theyve otaku year natural point instance drama even feel fresh two otaku start date start wonder really like one simply making compromise dating someone similar interest itd easier love episode play dynamic address appropriately since character adult actually stop talk partner instead keeping bottled insidethe humor notch wotakoi plenty anime manga video game reference anime doesnt rely solely funny appreciate fact reference noticed sort anime fan limited certain genre yearsthe main thing holding back wotakoi however production related animation isnt good bad either somewhere good adequate soundtrack kind get repetitive background track always playing least op ed phenomenal critiquecomment someone who huge fan manga wouldve loved see anime take chance animeonly material wouldve nice see studio could make moment character dynamic humor manga material either way wotakoi truly gem watch might rewatch point summer enjoyable without doubt ill playing opening theme least time weekside note doubt well getting nd season anytime soon maybe year anime basically covered manga chapter started relatively recently monthly updated manga there lot material thus far itll awhile enough material nd season available,positive,0.16195488721804507,0.4789598997493734
"So, I was never a fan of love stories nor comedy, I found those to be way too cliche and boring. This one, however, caught my interest due to the fact that it was a love story I could relate to; and that any other hardcore anime geek would relate to. I love the dynamic between the couples together and with each other and it just felt wholesome yet really cute. I recommend this to any hardcore anime geek who deep down hopes for a relationship with another geek. This anime even had me longing for a boyfriend who could share my geeky-ass personality.As...for the comedy part: I'm usually not a fan of comedy but this one had my bursting out laughing which actually felt really good. I feel that this could make anyone laugh due to the anime having four different main characters with their own personalities which will make the watcher relate to one or some of them more than the others making their actions enjoyable and even funny at times.",never fan love story comedy found way cliche boring one however caught interest due fact love story could relate hardcore anime geek would relate love dynamic couple together felt wholesome yet really cute recommend hardcore anime geek deep hope relationship another geek anime even longing boyfriend could share geekyass personalityasfor comedy part im usually fan comedy one bursting laughing actually felt really good feel could make anyone laugh due anime four different main character personality make watcher relate one others making action enjoyable even funny time,positive,0.1398148148148148,0.4888888888888887
"Wotakoi is a series that will more hit home for viewers who have experience having very close friends or romantic partners who share interests in anything anime, manga, cosplaying, or video games.Story: 6/10I came in with minimum expectations because romantic comedy is a bit iffy in my department and I am not the biggest fan of works by A-1 Pictures.  But for the first half, I found myself amused and laughing genuinely by the hilariously relatable situations of hiding your passions and interests from a society who wholeheartedly tends to think little of those involved in such activities.  It's not unusual for otakus...to initially be ashamed to share their love for anime and manga openly or sometimes becoming socially awkward because it is not a common topic with other people around you.  But it pushes the message that you should never feel ashamed of them and just find people who will accept you for who you are whether you have common interests or not.It's a romantic comedy so there is not necessarily a need for a plot but it felt as it they developed the relationship between Narumi and Hirotaka nicely for 5 episodes in the beginning and then nothing much happens from then.  The comedy became more hit and miss and I wasn't enjoying the episode stories afterwards.  I also am not personally appealed by video game concept episodes so I wasn't intrigued by the RPG portions of the episodes and there were only 2 more episodes after episode 5 where they kept on further developing Narumi and Hirotaka's relationship.  So the story felt very lackluster in the 2nd half.  Not to mention the final episode did not feel like a finale and did not make for a fitting farewell unless they plan a 2nd season.Characters: 7/10Talk about a diverse cast!  A yaoi fangirl, a gamer, a cross-dressing cosplayer, and a moe-loving manga reader.  The characters were very well portrayed in the funny yet serious hardships people can have when they are interested in different subtopics of the otaku industry.  They have their favorites but become very accepting of each others' hobbies which makes for a genuine group of friends that is very enjoyable to witness.  They have their moments when they argue and fight about their differences but they are aware that they all share the struggle of being in the minority in their work industry so they are practically all they have in terms of sharing interests.  The Hirotaka and Narumi relationship was more for starting and developing since they started uncomfortable for being childhood friends and then decided to date.  But their relationship felt real since they slowly became more comfortable with each other and slowly began to learn something new from each other every episode.  Hanako and Tarou's relationship was more real because they have personalities that clash much more volatilely and their devotion to one another despite the constant arguments was cuter and brought upon the most comedy for the time that this anime was good.The story began to take a turn for the worse when Hirotaka's brother was introduced.  Some can defend this saying that there are those who feel left out when their friends or siblings have a hobby they are dedicated to while they have nothing special about them.  I personally could not stand his presence.  The comedy was falling apart when he got introduced and I felt he was more of a nuisance towards the antics of the main cast.  I can see how this could have worked but I was not able to accept him as a useful character and found him more annoying and given more screentime than deserved.Art/Animation: 7/10I don't pay attention to art or animation unless it's grand or horrible so both sections were solid.  But the colors were bright and nice so it was able to stand out and look cute in its own way.Sound: 7/10Nothing that stands out other than those 20 seconds of the opening that is just so adorable!!!  You know what I'm talking about. :)Enjoyment: 5/10This is not a series that will appeal to everyone.  As much as I loved the characters in this series, it felt as if the anime did enough for them to bring me anywhere.  The characters just went on with their lives as soon as Hirotaka and Narumi were settled but I was bored after Hirotaka's brother made his debut.  If a 2nd season ever gets announced, I don't see myself watching it.  The comedy was not strong enough to push the series without a story and that's a problem when the comedy is the center of said series such as this.  The comedy failed and the romance, the stronger the portion, could have been giving more (or better) attention.",wotakoi series hit home viewer experience close friend romantic partner share interest anything anime manga cosplaying video gamesstory came minimum expectation romantic comedy bit iffy department biggest fan work picture first half found amused laughing genuinely hilariously relatable situation hiding passion interest society wholeheartedly tends think little involved activity unusual otakusto initially ashamed share love anime manga openly sometimes becoming socially awkward common topic people around push message never feel ashamed find people accept whether common interest notits romantic comedy necessarily need plot felt developed relationship narumi hirotaka nicely episode beginning nothing much happens comedy became hit miss wasnt enjoying episode story afterwards also personally appealed video game concept episode wasnt intrigued rpg portion episode episode episode kept developing narumi hirotakas relationship story felt lackluster nd half mention final episode feel like finale make fitting farewell unless plan nd seasoncharacters talk diverse cast yaoi fangirl gamer crossdressing cosplayer moeloving manga reader character well portrayed funny yet serious hardship people interested different subtopics otaku industry favorite become accepting others hobby make genuine group friend enjoyable witness moment argue fight difference aware share struggle minority work industry practically term sharing interest hirotaka narumi relationship starting developing since started uncomfortable childhood friend decided date relationship felt real since slowly became comfortable slowly began learn something new every episode hanako tarous relationship real personality clash much volatilely devotion one another despite constant argument cuter brought upon comedy time anime goodthe story began take turn worse hirotakas brother introduced defend saying feel left friend sibling hobby dedicated nothing special personally could stand presence comedy falling apart got introduced felt nuisance towards antic main cast see could worked able accept useful character found annoying given screentime deservedartanimation dont pay attention art animation unless grand horrible section solid color bright nice able stand look cute waysound nothing stand second opening adorable know im talking enjoyment series appeal everyone much loved character series felt anime enough bring anywhere character went life soon hirotaka narumi settled bored hirotakas brother made debut nd season ever get announced dont see watching comedy strong enough push series without story thats problem comedy center said series comedy failed romance stronger portion could giving better attention,positive,0.09543146804176217,0.5530780494015788
"I watched many romance animes in last 5 years. i love this genre. In fact i bored in half of it at first try but after few months i forced myself to end it. I enjoyed a bit. It wasn't half bad. But somehow it kinda felt like watching newbie's creation. As expected Wotaku was author's first piece. And he does both of art and story, probably he gonna make better piece later. This is why i reviewing this anime.Seems like author studied on romance stories bit a lot.It's about of office worker's love story but they're otaku. And there goes love story. If...you watched romance anime a lot, u'd probably bored in middle of it. Just force ur butt and finish it. It may can bore u a bit it's good.Character's art good but background is not good. Also gaming scenes were irate me, that was maybe cute but i really disappointed of that. If someone puts gaming scenes into their piece they should work on them hard. Gaming scenes should be one of main event in this series NOT FILLER!.Op, ed, osts were normal. They should work on them. Voice actresses were good as usual.Hirotaka just pulled this series to better way. In first sight Narumi seemed like b*tch in flashback stories. But it's not reason why i don't like Narumi character side. Maybe she has some good sides but she has to be unique side which one that made him shine. It made her like normal sh*t (btw she may can be otaku but f*ck that that's only base role...). In fact Hirotaka pulled him to shine, lol.Hanako x Tarou was normal cute couple. But felt like filler.If this story continues as anime in sequels Hirotaka's little brother and Kou-chan would make very very cute and good romance story line.Kou's appearance was good. In anime Naoya didn't regonized she's a girl.I enjoyed a bit. But i looking forward to sequel.

"This anime was very refreshing. Its storyline is among the most realistic out there which makes it very relatable and having something this relatable makes you soon grow attached to the characters. It covers many aspects of love being difficult for people with special interests. Finding it, maintaining it and growing through it. I also loved how it portrayed the insecurities of not just individuals in a relationship but also of average people in general- how we try to change ourselves to fit an image that is more acceptable in society.Among the few downsides of this anime are:- The similarities in MC names (this...was a personal peeve right from the first episode and confused me as a non-Japanese speaker. This is breaking a basal story rule of not having characters of similar sounding/spelt names in close association)- The boyfriend, girlfriend titles seems to be just a formality at times to provide a connection between two characters even when at times the couple does not behave as so (But you feel this is intentional as the characters don't want to draw unnecessary attention to themselves and honestly it gets better towards the last few episodes)- It gets better towards the end and has promise for the future. It should have been longer or had a second season.- The mature relationship is not portrayed quite accurately. There doesn't seem to be enough going on between the pair to have kept them together 'unmarried' for as many years as is implied.- Its target audience is narrow (enjoyable by those who can relate: various degrees of otakus).More positives:- The animation tries to outdo its own sphere and it's not bad.- The voice actors are perfect for their characters.- The number of true-to-life moments that occur in this anime is very high.- The opening and ending songs lyrically are on point for the story and the tunes as well are quite nice- like someone put the effort in.- There are no tropes being abused here, nor employed. It's just anime characters who are so realistic you just might know someone (or be that someone) who shares their story.- Being such a light-hearted anime while still being deep (with its various devices: dialogue, backstory, solid characters...) and able to elicit various emotions from you at just the right amounts so that it's not drama should be a huge reason for anyone to watch it (if you're an otaku)- It is not swarming with aesthetically perfect characters. Most of them are average looking living average lives.- No melodrama.",anime refreshing storyline among realistic make relatable something relatable make soon grow attached character cover many aspect love difficult people special interest finding maintaining growing also loved portrayed insecurity individual relationship also average people general try change fit image acceptable societyamong downside anime similarity mc name thiswas personal peeve right first episode confused nonjapanese speaker breaking basal story rule character similar soundingspelt name close association boyfriend girlfriend title seems formality time provide connection two character even time couple behave feel intentional character dont want draw unnecessary attention honestly get better towards last episode get better towards end promise future longer second season mature relationship portrayed quite accurately doesnt seem enough going pair kept together unmarried many year implied target audience narrow enjoyable relate various degree otakusmore positive animation try outdo sphere bad voice actor perfect character number truetolife moment occur anime high opening ending song lyrically point story tune well quite nice like someone put effort trope abused employed anime character realistic might know someone someone share story lighthearted anime still deep various device dialogue backstory solid character able elicit various emotion right amount drama huge reason anyone watch youre otaku swarming aesthetically perfect character average looking living average life melodrama,positive,0.17445058487611678,0.524361241595284
"Ah Wotakoi, you were probably my biggest disappointment in the shoujo genre.It all started with a promising ideia, it's not everyday you see a romance story between adults, I know that I haven't seen a lot of those, and instead of showing a different perception of what love means we got a bunch of 25 years old characters acting like teenagers and no development in the main couple relationship, and it doesn't even seems like anyone dates in this at all. Oh, and the jokes were also bad.Besides that, there isn't a lot to say about this no because it's just generic and not funny,...and to be honest it would have been a little less better if the characters were actually teenagers because then their behaviour would make sense and match their age. I also disliked how obsessed all the characters were, I know it was supposed to be the ""funny"" part of this but it just wasn't, if anything it just made it more annoying and was treated like a reason to delay all kind of development.",ah wotakoi probably biggest disappointment shoujo genreit started promising ideia everyday see romance story adult know havent seen lot instead showing different perception love mean got bunch year old character acting like teenager development main couple relationship doesnt even seems like anyone date oh joke also badbesides isnt lot say generic funnyand honest would little less better character actually teenager behaviour would make sense match age also disliked obsessed character know supposed funny part wasnt anything made annoying treated like reason delay kind development,positive,0.0023809523809523777,0.5089285714285714

"I was interested to see how the perspective of otaku’s fit into the working world. I can see the resemblance between the anime and I. The way they convey otaku’s is very standard with their double identity with each character showing their insecurities and fighting through the adult lifestyle which they are adapting to. As we follow the main female protagonist Momose, we can see her quiet persona with a inner conversation about how she cares for each individual liking for anime, games, manga, characters and cosplay events which occur to those otaku fanatics. It is vey appealing and sort of realistic with the same...mentality as an otaku myself. I can say with ease that each person has felt that distance with others who aren’t a fan or who do not understand the different things that are being watched or done because it fits outside of the norm. It is alright, maybe there are traits and character to each person which is represented here in this anime. Although the animation is lacking due to the difficulty developing an anime, and the very limited detailing in certain background and foreground materialistic items, buildings and the overall surrounding makes this anime kind of quirky. Which can be a good thing but with the amazing animation on the characters, this is no exception to the quirkiness of the rest of the animation.With this cut down version of my full review I can say this is a decent anime to watch for those who are lacking in social and ‘normal’ activities that otaku’s need to adapt to.

"I feel like there was so much flying by through this anime without anything specific ever happening, and I don't know how to write a review for something like that. A 7 is sort of the best I could give it because of how fragmented this series was, even though there were a few parts that I really liked. Much like the anime itself, my opinions about it are all over the place, so let's try and figure out what I think of it:Starting with the bad here, the pacing was so weird. I haven't read the manga, but if this adaptation is faithful, I...gather that it isn't a linear story that's being told but rather smaller stories with the connecting factor being the romance. That kind of structure doesn't really sit well with me because there's never a place to rest and enjoy the series. It feels far too scattered, even if the goal wasn't to create a story but simply show the lives of these characters. But that's the thing: whether it was supposed to be one story or something closer to Kimi to Boku, it didn't succeed in either. It pulled enough of the romance's plot points forward to make me crave a fleshed out story, so it came out feeling choppy instead of episodic. Also choppy was the humor. There were times it worked nicely, but only when it was more traditional anime humor; anything that felt Wotakoi-specific was actually kind of grating to listen to.Speaking of the romance, I don't think I'd agree with the harshest reviews of this anime that say it isn't a romance at all; it definitely is, but it's just not like every other romance anime where the characters take forever to realize they're in love and then take forever to get together. The romance in Wotakoi is almost background noise for how little it's addressed, though it does also have a few moments where it's directly addressed. But those moments aren't the ones that get carried forward. I feel like there were direct statements of a certain character's feelings, like, multiple times throughout this season, and those statements never got addressed. So, even though the romance is there throughout the season, the relationship development of the main couple is so inconsistent it makes it annoying to be invested in them.But there are a few charming points about Wotakoi that kept me watching. The characters, for one thing, got a lot better over time. Again, the humorous aspects were often hit or miss--though I found that that didn't apply to ever character; I felt the boys were much more consistently funny than the girls, which I think is due to the girls' characterization being quite over-the-top and sporadic--but when they hit, they made the most of the characters and the moment itself. The seriousness of the anime increased the longer it went on, which balanced it a lot better and left me satisfied at the end of episodes more often. Adding onto that, when there was actually a proper attempt at romance made, it was done super well. Usually the build-up to them was effective, though I'd say the way the plot used humor to come out of them didn't always work. But it's those moments that makes me want to continue this story in the manga, even if I could give-or-take the rest of the series elements.At the end of the day, I did end up being fond of these characters and how they are when they're around each other, but the main character was far too flat for her to stick out as especially important (which is why I got so excited when she was actually serious in a scene), and the characters weren't quite enough to carry the series for me. Still, it's a decent enough watch if you just want something cute to pass the time with. I don't know if I'll brave the manga or not, but either way, at least I've got this anime off of my PTW list.",feel like much flying anime without anything specific ever happening dont know write review something like sort best could give fragmented series even though part really liked much like anime opinion place let try figure think itstarting bad pacing weird havent read manga adaptation faithful igather isnt linear story thats told rather smaller story connecting factor romance kind structure doesnt really sit well there never place rest enjoy series feel far scattered even goal wasnt create story simply show life character thats thing whether supposed one story something closer kimi boku didnt succeed either pulled enough romance plot point forward make crave fleshed story came feeling choppy instead episodic also choppy humor time worked nicely traditional anime humor anything felt wotakoispecific actually kind grating listen tospeaking romance dont think id agree harshest review anime say isnt romance definitely like every romance anime character take forever realize theyre love take forever get together romance wotakoi almost background noise little addressed though also moment directly addressed moment arent one get carried forward feel like direct statement certain character feeling like multiple time throughout season statement never got addressed even though romance throughout season relationship development main couple inconsistent make annoying invested thembut charming point wotakoi kept watching character one thing got lot better time humorous aspect often hit missthough found didnt apply ever character felt boy much consistently funny girl think due girl characterization quite overthetop sporadicbut hit made character moment seriousness anime increased longer went balanced lot better left satisfied end episode often adding onto actually proper attempt romance made done super well usually buildup effective though id say way plot used humor come didnt always work moment make want continue story manga even could giveortake rest series elementsat end day end fond character theyre around main character far flat stick especially important got excited actually serious scene character werent quite enough carry series still decent enough watch want something cute pas time dont know ill brave manga either way least ive got anime ptw list,positive,0.14714972527472528,0.5699404761904763
"I always try to wait until I finish a show before I write a review, and this one was exceptionally hard to do so! In a season where it has to compete both with the end of Darling in the Franx, and the beginning of Steins;Gate 0, this series still stood out to me as something special.Upfront, I'll admit I have a bias to romances. However, the show uses different techniques, styles, and characterizations that seem to feel familiar while also remaining somewhat grounded. I'll go into mainly the story, the art, and the characters for this review.Story: The show (only having eleven episodes) starts...right off the bat, showing that the season follows Hirotaka and Narumi as they navigate the ups and downs of their newly formed relationship. Unlike most anime with ""childhood friends,"" this one actually shows them being successful in courting their prospective partner accompanied with the aftermath. Rather than simply following their relationship however, it compares and contrasts their relationship with two others in the show. For the sake of spoilers, I'll not mention names. However, the contrasts can show the differences in familiarity, respect, and hobbies that one encounters in any relationship. Although the group of friends all bond of otaku culture, they simultaneously have other hobbies or interests that don't necessarily overlap. The show uses this to represent how just because a couple shares a common bond, doesn't mean they need to necessarily be the same person. The three relationships shown are thoughtful, insightful, and show us fears and insecurities just as much as the ups.Art: The art style for this show focuses much less on beautiful visuals and animations, and much more on small otaku or video game references. Even in the final episode, I was seeing other anime referenced in the background almost fully on display, as if to advertise it. While at first I thought it was distracting, I feel they actually were trying to bring a sense of depth and atmosphere to places outside of the workplace, the most common setting for the majority of the show. I think that the flares for the dramatic the art style had such as RPG popup menus, robotic voices, and background references went a long way in developing a style all on its own.Characters: Finally, the best and brightest part of this show is the character developments. For a relationship show, I don't know if I could find another that actually follows the ups and downs of a relationship without trying to be as depressing as ""Scum's Wish"". The insecurities these characters have feel realistic, and while they might not be worrying about the infidelity of their partner, they might be wondering ""am I good enough?"" One of the most basic human fears, not being worth someone's time. Past that, characters don't immediately appear lovey dovey, but you can see and feel the affections the characters hold. They're used to each other, they're familiar to each other, thus things like kisses, sexual situations, and dates are handled with a mature mindset that can be hard to find in many anime.Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii bring a lot to the table in terms of character and story. Personally, if Darling in the Franxx or Steins;Gate 0 weren't airing this season it would probably be my anime of the season. Overall, I believe this show is worth your time, and I'll be holding out for a season 2.",always try wait finish show write review one exceptionally hard season compete end darling franx beginning steinsgate series still stood something specialupfront ill admit bias romance however show us different technique style characterization seem feel familiar also remaining somewhat grounded ill go mainly story art character reviewstory show eleven episode startsright bat showing season follows hirotaka narumi navigate ups down newly formed relationship unlike anime childhood friend one actually show successful courting prospective partner accompanied aftermath rather simply following relationship however compare contrast relationship two others show sake spoiler ill mention name however contrast show difference familiarity respect hobby one encounter relationship although group friend bond otaku culture simultaneously hobby interest dont necessarily overlap show us represent couple share common bond doesnt mean need necessarily person three relationship shown thoughtful insightful show u fear insecurity much upsart art style show focus much less beautiful visuals animation much small otaku video game reference even final episode seeing anime referenced background almost fully display advertise first thought distracting feel actually trying bring sense depth atmosphere place outside workplace common setting majority show think flare dramatic art style rpg popup menu robotic voice background reference went long way developing style owncharacters finally best brightest part show character development relationship show dont know could find another actually follows ups down relationship without trying depressing scum wish insecurity character feel realistic might worrying infidelity partner might wondering good enough one basic human fear worth someone time past character dont immediately appear lovey dovey see feel affection character hold theyre used theyre familiar thus thing like kiss sexual situation date handled mature mindset hard find many animewotaku ni koi wa muzukashii bring lot table term character story personally darling franxx steinsgate werent airing season would probably anime season overall believe show worth time ill holding season,positive,0.01397553971083383,0.4642775797187562
"Similar to Net-juu no Susume, the show consists of a slightly older cast of characters; we follow the lives of small group of otaku in their mid to late 20’s. Wotakoi is unique, though, in that it begins where most other romantic dramadies typically end—with our protagonists actually in a relationship.It’s apparent that there wasn’t too much of a budget to work with here, but they get along well enough via cost/time cutting measures like shot selections that don’t require a whole lot of actual animation.Wotakoi is not the prettiest or most comical show in the world, but it is endearing in its own way....This is a good one either wind down or wake up with.

"Good romantic comedy anime titles are hard to come by nowadays, and many of them that I have seen recently are derivative, cliched, and overall not romantic or funny in the slightest.

The first episode eventually came out, and I was struck by how fresh, funny, and unpretentious the show was.

"A slice-of-life romcom that started off as a comic on the Japanese online artists community Pixiv before being serialised as a web comic. 26 year old Narumi Momose seems like your average optimistic cheery girl but she has a secret. She doesn't want anyone to find out she's an Otaku (geek) because guys always dump her when they find out she's also a ""Fujoshi [rotting girl, word play that refers to women/girls]"" - a girl who is into ""Boys Love (explicitly illustrated fiction featuring gay men relations)"". After her last boyfriend left her, she decided to start afresh at a new company and tries to...keep her Otaku nature a secret but she soon finds out she wasn't the only Otaku there. Her childhood friend Hirotaka Nifuji who isn't a fairly socialable gaming Otaku also happened to be working there and there was also fellow Fujoshi, Hinako Koyanagi who cosplays as male characters and was a fan of her self-published BL. Hinako's rash, angry looking but considerate boyfriend Tarou Kabakura is also a bit of an Otaku too but hardly shows it.As Narumi and Hirotaka catch up she reveals how she doesn't have any luck with guys. She never makes a mistake in dating sim games so she doesn't understand why it never works out but, doesn't want to date an Otaku who might be more accepting of her because she considers them disgusting. However, when Hirotaka points out he can be really accepting of her Otaku habits and always be with her like in an RPG, Narumi decides to give him a chance. And so, a new relation begins for the new Otaku couple but as they hang out together with Hinako and Tarou, they feel like something's not quite right.When you think of an Anime about Otaku you'd probably think of classics like Genshiken but this show feels quite different. Probably it's set pass the stage of uni clubs and right into working adulthood. It's a cute show with an opening that features a dance with fun hand gestures. Narumi has cute expressions and it's always entertaining when she's trying to help people around her. It's fun watching the couples get caught up in each other's little fights or just supporting each other too. Geeks watching this will probably be able to relate a lot to the show right away. It's filled with emoji since Hirotaka isn't very good at expressing himself. There's even features footage from Monster Hunter X on the Switch.Actually, you'll see a lot of product placements in it, no parodies like the usual Anime and lots of references to other Anime shows like Macross, Evangelion, One Punch Man and Maison Ikkoku. Part of the fun is recognising them all so unless you've seen a lot of shows or played a lot of games then you'll probably miss a lot of the references. Some of them are actual phrases that were pretty much lost in translation with the subtitles I was watching such as Hanako saying ""yoroshii, naraba krieg da [Then krieg is what you shall have]"". This meant she was declaring war but is also a reference to a line used in Hellsing when a 13 page speech was given in the Manga - in other words, a fierce argument ahead.There's also a fair bit of Otaku lingo too which is interpreted fine but you kind of miss out on the fun lingo - a bit like the time when Densha Otoko was released and there had to be a glossary. Best one for me was probably ""imakita sangyo"" - short for ""I just got here, please summarise what's been going on"" on 2ch forum.There's nothing too explicit in this show but since it stars two Fujoshis, there are times you hear and visually see what they're fantasising about men in gay relationships so you might not like it if you're a guy. Thankfully they rarely occur - I've only seen it happen once in the entire series. Show looks great, nice clean art like most of A-1 Pictures slice-of-life shows and the music's mostly cheery too.So if you're not bothered by the odd Fujoshi fantasy going wild, it's mostly a straight cute romcom that isn't overly mushy. Don't miss out on the extra scenes after the ending. The show just gets better as it progresses.Looking forward to a season two!",sliceoflife romcom started comic japanese online artist community pixiv serialised web comic year old narumi momose seems like average optimistic cheery girl secret doesnt want anyone find shes otaku geek guy always dump find shes also fujoshi rotting girl word play refers womengirls girl boy love explicitly illustrated fiction featuring gay men relation last boyfriend left decided start afresh new company try tokeep otaku nature secret soon find wasnt otaku childhood friend hirotaka nifuji isnt fairly socialable gaming otaku also happened working also fellow fujoshi hinako koyanagi cosplays male character fan selfpublished bl hinakos rash angry looking considerate boyfriend tarou kabakura also bit otaku hardly show itas narumi hirotaka catch reveals doesnt luck guy never make mistake dating sim game doesnt understand never work doesnt want date otaku might accepting considers disgusting however hirotaka point really accepting otaku habit always like rpg narumi decides give chance new relation begin new otaku couple hang together hinako tarou feel like somethings quite rightwhen think anime otaku youd probably think classic like genshiken show feel quite different probably set pas stage uni club right working adulthood cute show opening feature dance fun hand gesture narumi cute expression always entertaining shes trying help people around fun watching couple get caught others little fight supporting geek watching probably able relate lot show right away filled emoji since hirotaka isnt good expressing there even feature footage monster hunter x switchactually youll see lot product placement parody like usual anime lot reference anime show like macross evangelion one punch man maison ikkoku part fun recognising unless youve seen lot show played lot game youll probably miss lot reference actual phrase pretty much lost translation subtitle watching hanako saying yoroshii naraba krieg da krieg shall meant declaring war also reference line used hellsing page speech given manga word fierce argument aheadtheres also fair bit otaku lingo interpreted fine kind miss fun lingo bit like time densha otoko released glossary best one probably imakita sangyo short got please summarise whats going ch forumtheres nothing explicit show since star two fujoshis time hear visually see theyre fantasising men gay relationship might like youre guy thankfully rarely occur ive seen happen entire series show look great nice clean art like picture sliceoflife show music mostly cheery tooso youre bothered odd fujoshi fantasy going wild mostly straight cute romcom isnt overly mushy dont miss extra scene ending show get better progresseslooking forward season two,positive,0.19867773355676582,0.5165601871247031

"If you want to feel butterflies and sigh wishing you were the main character, this ones for you! I've been looking for so long for an anime like this and Ive finally found it. All i can say is that I did enjoy this show despite it being so short.*Stuff i think couldved been improved with the story:First major problem I had though is development. There was, it did exist, but its too small of a development. In my opinion there should've been more progress between the two characters, thats what made the anime lack.Second is the secondary main couple, Hana and Kabakura. They...may be funny but their relationship makes me concerned. I feel like if you remove the veil of comedy, their relationship would make you worry. There's bursts of sweetness here and there, but if this kind of relationship existed in real life it wouldn't last for long. The first thing that comes to mind to Kabakura when asked what he liked about her is big boobs, seriously?Third, the background, world-building. It feels like a mess. I feel as if there was no proper build-up. Hirotakas confession(?) wouldve been more romantic if there was proper backstories and foreshadowing. Also that one episode where the two male leads drank with their coworkers, why didnt they just admit they were the boyfriends then? There's a lot of things that weren't properly explainedFourth. The fact that they would often call others beautiful and look at them differently despite being in a relationship. Its always made me uncomfortable. Kabakura compliments Narumi jokingly and shit like that, Narumi even once stared too much at the barista whom she did not know was Hirotakas brother... like yeah I get it, being attracted isnt bad, but shouldnt you limit yourself with that when youre in a relationship?Thats all.

"It's nice to see an office romance between adults instead of your typical high school drama. While common in live action romantic comedies, it's not a setting you find very often in anime. The fact that the main girl is a closet otaku/fujoshi is just icing on the cake.I love Narumi trying to hide her power level only to get outed by Hirotaka on her first day. Then it turns out that every other person they work with is some kind of otaku or another. Narumi writes BL, Hanako cosplays, Hirotaka is a gamer and Tarou is the resident lolicon. I like that many different...facets of otaku culture are all represented, and in a pretty authentic way. It's not like western ""nerd"" shows where they take every opportunity to remind you, oh boy these guys are nerds look at how nerdy they are.

As someone who enjoys anime and could easily be categorized as various kinds of Otaku, I can say that this definitely had some good references to Otaku's life and culture, mostly to positive comedic effects.It is pretty good at this...comedic aspect, and the art is solid. Definitely some meme-worthy humor overall. However, there is next to no plot. While I understand it's a romance anime and that's not the focus, I would be amiss in not pointing that out.Overall, if you are an Otaku (and let's face it, if you are reading my rather mediocre review of an anime titled: ""Love is Hard for Otaku"" you definitely are,) then you will probably get a kick out of this. I can't testify to whether the romantic parts are of good quality or not because I don't watch enough of it, but it didn't seem noticeably bad.",love hard otaku isnt typical anime recommended friend figured id try want preface statement dont find lot appeal anime centered around romancenow said typical anime centered around romance anime romance otakus someone enjoys anime could easily categorized various kind otaku say definitely good reference otakus life culture mostly positive comedic effectsit pretty good thiscomedic aspect art solid definitely memeworthy humor overall however next plot understand romance anime thats focus would amiss pointing outoverall otaku let face reading rather mediocre review anime titled love hard otaku definitely probably get kick cant testify whether romantic part good quality dont watch enough didnt seem noticeably bad,positive,0.10843214756258238,0.5490777338603424
"To sum up - almost every episode is a slice of life, otaku double date.The thing I enjoyed most about the series was the references to otaku culture, anime, manga, games etc. I also found the relationship dynamics quite amusing at times. Most of my enjoyment from the series was definitely the relatability and otaku references. I also liked the aesthetics and the setting.Unfortunately I felt that the story as a whole was lacking. There was barely any structure to the entire series never mind individual episodes, and there was little to no character development for any of the cast individually or as couples....I went into the anime expecting (and hoping) for more of a romcom experience, however there wasn't enough of either romance or comedy to be able to class it as such. For me, the humour purely came from the relatability and real-life references so if you're somehow on MyAnimeList but don't know much about otaku culture then you're probably not going to get much out of this series.Words I'd use to describe the series overall: felt unfinished, lacking structure, little character development, little romance, unique presentation, fun real-life references, humorous otaku culture references, slice of life, uneventful, chilled.Overall I enjoyed the series but I probably wouldn't re-watch. 6/10.",sum almost every episode slice life otaku double datethe thing enjoyed series reference otaku culture anime manga game etc also found relationship dynamic quite amusing time enjoyment series definitely relatability otaku reference also liked aesthetic settingunfortunately felt story whole lacking barely structure entire series never mind individual episode little character development cast individually couplesi went anime expecting hoping romcom experience however wasnt enough either romance comedy able class humour purely came relatability reallife reference youre somehow myanimelist dont know much otaku culture youre probably going get much serieswords id use describe series overall felt unfinished lacking structure little character development little romance unique presentation fun reallife reference humorous otaku culture reference slice life uneventful chilledoverall enjoyed series probably wouldnt rewatch,positive,0.15107142857142858,0.4766666666666666
Great Animevery relatable for most of us because you know most otakus have trouble finding/falling in love with normies cause they have different likes and personalities and this anime shows that kind of reality that most of us are in and this anime showed every single kind of otakus and how they handle their daily lives living among normies that will judge or avoid them like Momose's past relationships. and how they simply don't care about others' opinions about them like Hirotaka's personality. overall I really enjoyed it and I have fun watching this type of series I highly recommend it for Romantic Comedy watchers...out there.,great animevery relatable u know otakus trouble findingfalling love normies cause different like personality anime show kind reality u anime showed every single kind otakus handle daily life living among normies judge avoid like momos past relationship simply dont care others opinion like hirotakas personality overall really enjoyed fun watching type series highly recommend romantic comedy watchersout,positive,0.19590476190476191,0.44742857142857145

"Story: The Story was really simple. Just a couple of childhood friends who rekindle a friendship at work which ends up resulting in a relationship. Along with another couple who they work with the anime follows the daily lvies of these four Otaku and the struggles of dating an Otaku.Art and Animation: Very clear, clean, and crisp. This anime was very easy on the eyes. With A-1 producing it I did not expect anything less.Sound and Music: The opening is probably the best of the season. the song is super catchy and you basically just want to get up and dance with the characters. The...music throughout the series is not really noticeable which is not a bad thing. The voice actors did a tremendous job.Characters: The broke down the dynamic of anime fans pretty well minus our two female leads. They were even able to work in a ""Non-Otaku"" to make it feel more real in my eyes.You have your two fujoshi fan girls in Narumi and Koyonagi who at most times disagreed with who they ""ship"" in certain series.Narumi you find out right away is a Doujinshi Artist.Koyonagi's hobby gets found out pretty quickly as well, as we find out she is a popular cosplayer. I would have liked if the anime went more into these two and their hobbies but they did enough in my eyes for how the anime turned out.We then have Hirotaka who has a more laid back and chilled personality and focuses his time on games. IE the game Otaku. He and Narumi are dating.Then have Kabukura who is the boss at the office that they all work at. He is dating Koyonagi.Kabukura is basically your average Otaku. He prefers Yuri manga and anime. His clashes with Koyonagi can be pretty funny at times. There are some serious moments between them as well which really make the anime feel more realistic.Bringing back the ""Non-Otaku"" we come to find out about Hirotaka's younger brother Naoya. Naoya works at a local coffee shop near the office that our main characters work at. He has absolutely no skills when it comes to playing video games or when it comes to watching anime. They even refer to him as a ""Normie"" in the anime which I found pretty funny.He eventually meet Kou Sakuragi a classmate of his and they form a friendship over a PC game.I was kind of upset that Kou was introduced so late because I liked the character a lot.Enjoyment: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I though the comedy was really well done and I love it when an anime makes references to other anime.Overall: I thought this was one of the best anime in Spring 2018. However this anime is not for everyone. I feel like it's more for people who can relate being an Otaku. There's just certain references I feel like most anime watchers would not understand.If you are looking for a great comedy though I would recommend it.",story story really simple couple childhood friend rekindle friendship work end resulting relationship along another couple work anime follows daily lvies four otaku struggle dating otakuart animation clear clean crisp anime easy eye producing expect anything lesssound music opening probably best season song super catchy basically want get dance character themusic throughout series really noticeable bad thing voice actor tremendous jobcharacters broke dynamic anime fan pretty well minus two female lead even able work nonotaku make feel real eyesyou two fujoshi fan girl narumi koyonagi time disagreed ship certain seriesnarumi find right away doujinshi artistkoyonagis hobby get found pretty quickly well find popular cosplayer would liked anime went two hobby enough eye anime turned outwe hirotaka laid back chilled personality focus time game ie game otaku narumi datingthen kabukura bos office work dating koyonagikabukura basically average otaku prefers yuri manga anime clash koyonagi pretty funny time serious moment well really make anime feel realisticbringing back nonotaku come find hirotakas younger brother naoya naoya work local coffee shop near office main character work absolutely skill come playing video game come watching anime even refer normie anime found pretty funnyhe eventually meet kou sakuragi classmate form friendship pc gamei kind upset kou introduced late liked character lotenjoyment thoroughly enjoyed anime though comedy really well done love anime make reference animeoverall thought one best anime spring however anime everyone feel like people relate otaku there certain reference feel like anime watcher would understandif looking great comedy though would recommend,positive,0.1897473275024295,0.5145043731778426
"Wotakoi is a situational comedy for people who enjoy the anime flavor of things. We get to follow two couples around as they work, go have a drink and attend comicon events. The main protagonists in this tale are Nifuji and Momose. Nifuji is an inconspicuous and self-contained gamer. Momose is a fujoshi and manga artist. They start a relationship, seemly out of convenience at first. Despite what the titles implies, their relationship is not hard on them by any means. In fact they get along pretty well.The same cannot be said about the second couple, formed by Konayagi, a cosplayer fanatic and Kabakura,...a YuriYuri fan and apparently a figure collector (he talks about it a couple of times but we never get to see his collection, which is a bummer to be honest). They often have theatrical arguments over non-life-threatening things like Kabakura not wanting to cosplay as a girl or his refusal to read BL manga. Of course they always manage to overcome their differences and everything ends up being fine, because this is a feel good show.Talking about feeling good, the comedic sketches here are rarely funny, they're mostly amusing, built for 'feel good' purposes, though occasionally there's a chuckle here and there to be taken. Unlike with the manga, the show doesn't have that many references to otaku culture as the title might suggest. The show revolves a lot more around Momose and Nifuji getting used to be in a relationship on one side, and Konayagi and Kabakura fighting and making amends, on the other. A couple episodes have a lot of references to gaming, a couple others have some manga and anime references but it's mostly a superficial thing that doesn't have to be there for the stories to work out.This is the perfect palat cleanser for when you finish watching something with a lot of earth threatening monsters, androids fighting aliens, mechas, and teenagers that can fly and destroy buildings with a single punch. The romance is subtle and sparingly used, the characters are likable, distinct and wholesome. I just wish there was more otaku things on Wotakoi. I still can't get over the fact we never get to see the figures hoarded by Kabakura.",wotakoi situational comedy people enjoy anime flavor thing get follow two couple around work go drink attend comicon event main protagonist tale nifuji momose nifuji inconspicuous selfcontained gamer momose fujoshi manga artist start relationship seemly convenience first despite title implies relationship hard mean fact get along pretty wellthe said second couple formed konayagi cosplayer fanatic kabakuraa yuriyuri fan apparently figure collector talk couple time never get see collection bummer honest often theatrical argument nonlifethreatening thing like kabakura wanting cosplay girl refusal read bl manga course always manage overcome difference everything end fine feel good showtalking feeling good comedic sketch rarely funny theyre mostly amusing built feel good purpose though occasionally there chuckle taken unlike manga show doesnt many reference otaku culture title might suggest show revolves lot around momose nifuji getting used relationship one side konayagi kabakura fighting making amends couple episode lot reference gaming couple others manga anime reference mostly superficial thing doesnt story work outthis perfect palat cleanser finish watching something lot earth threatening monster android fighting alien mechas teenager fly destroy building single punch romance subtle sparingly used character likable distinct wholesome wish otaku thing wotakoi still cant get fact never get see figure hoarded kabakura,positive,0.2473001700680272,0.536968537414966
"A great slice of life anime for young working adults.  Hits the feels, gets the laughs, does its job!Objectively, if I were to say anything bad about this anime, the art and animation can sometimes leave some things to be desired, but I feel as though those things don't matter too much in a comedic anime such as this one.  I could say the same about the sound design, not including the voice acting.  Voice acting was great, and the performances mixed with the writing and the visual comedy kept this anime propelling forward even if there might be little to...no actual plot.I loved this anime and it really resonated with me.

"The manga is one of my current top favourites, and when I heard it'll be adapted into an anime, I was nervous because I have high expectations naturally. Luckily I'm not disappointed thus far! It definitely doesn't look like a low budget anime adaptation (like Orange, ahem).I like WotaKoi for the slice-of-life, josei storyline and the characters are interesting yet believable. The story sticks very closely to its main theme of love and friendship between working adults. I like the pace of the story's development, it's subtle rather than dramatic and has an easygoing, effortless feeling to it, which is a lot more realistic...and a breath of fresh air from dramatic incidents. This show is meant for the viewer to kick back and enjoy it for how it resonates with the viewer's daily life and hobbies. I can confirm this, because I'm also an otaku somewhat. ^^The art is really close to the manga and the colour palette tastefully chosen (thank god there). Sound-wise, there's nothing much to shout about but it's understandable because of the type of story and setting (vs historical epics or sci-fi fantasies, for example). The ED song is quite catchy. I do like how pauses are employed to enhance the dead-pan humour in certain scenes, plus the robotic narration is hilarious and a pretty smart replacement to the original manga's footnotes.I just finished ep7 before writing this, so I hope the rest of the episodes will be just as enjoyable. This is good entertainment, especially if you are a working adult otaku!",manga one current top favourite heard itll adapted anime nervous high expectation naturally luckily im disappointed thus far definitely doesnt look like low budget anime adaptation like orange ahemi like wotakoi sliceoflife josei storyline character interesting yet believable story stick closely main theme love friendship working adult like pace story development subtle rather dramatic easygoing effortless feeling lot realisticand breath fresh air dramatic incident show meant viewer kick back enjoy resonates viewer daily life hobby confirm im also otaku somewhat art really close manga colour palette tastefully chosen thank god soundwise there nothing much shout understandable type story setting v historical epic scifi fantasy example ed song quite catchy like pause employed enhance deadpan humour certain scene plus robotic narration hilarious pretty smart replacement original mangas footnotesi finished ep writing hope rest episode enjoyable good entertainment especially working adult otaku,positive,0.11706582633053221,0.5069887955182072
"An anime about a workplace surrounding four otaku like adults seems like a pretty good choice to watch, to consider that most of us are either still working while focusing on our game like hobbies, or we’re probably just underemployed waiting to see if we can get hired again. It also says a whole lot that these four characters in this show can make working in an office like workplace seem like the most interesting place to be productive in.Narumi and Hirotaka didn’t seem like to be type in the relationship at first, since Narumi wanted to hide her fujoshi like lifestyle from him. Meanwhile,...the surprising relationship between Koyanagi and Kabakura was probably my favorite on the show, considering that Koyanagi was the one that was into Kabakura trying on cosplay and yaoi for some reason. However, I do there was a second season where Hirotaka’s brother, Naoya, and Kō would explored a whole lot more since they did seem like the best example of opposites attract. It was beginning to be my second favorite relationship on this show.All in all, a surprising hilarious and heartfelt comedy where sometimes even when you do reach young adulthood, there are some things that you love that do not always go away. Also, I do appreciate the Monster Hunter references on this show, since the famous JRPG really does have a way to get people forming both friendly and in the case of Naoya and Hirotaka, familial relationships. It’s a great pairing.",anime workplace surrounding four otaku like adult seems like pretty good choice watch consider u either still working focusing game like hobby probably underemployed waiting see get hired also say whole lot four character show make working office like workplace seem like interesting place productive innarumi hirotaka didnt seem like type relationship first since narumi wanted hide fujoshi like lifestyle meanwhilethe surprising relationship koyanagi kabakura probably favorite show considering koyanagi one kabakura trying cosplay yaoi reason however second season hirotakas brother naoya k would explored whole lot since seem like best example opposite attract beginning second favorite relationship showall surprising hilarious heartfelt comedy sometimes even reach young adulthood thing love always go away also appreciate monster hunter reference show since famous jrpg really way get people forming friendly case naoya hirotaka familial relationship great pairing,positive,0.340625,0.5284722222222222
"SPOILERSWotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii: This anime lets just get right to the chase is pretty generic. Its pretty much just one of those humble cute anime that you binge on a rainy day. Its a partial comedy slice of life with a impactful 11 episodes. This anime came out spring of 2018 which makes it reletively new. Essentially its about a girl who gets a new job in a new city in japan. Shes a closet Otaku who loves anime and even creates Yaoi hentai on the low. She goes to her new job and end up meeting an old friend from middle school...who used to game with a lot.  This dudes like a super Otaku who games at any time he can. They end up catching up and becoming friends with each other, Also it turns out 2 other people who happen to be a couple are also otakus so they all basically become friends. The dude and the girl start to date because like damn why the fuck not. Anyway its basically a cute little story that will not dissapoint if you have nothing else to watch. Also the opening is literally one of the greatest i have ever listened to and seen i swear if u see this opening watch the animation it is so cute you will die not to mention the song is so good easily my top 10 ops. This song for capturing what it seeks to capture gets a solid 7.5/10 because its funny its cute and has a nice opening but I would not call it impactful or like hilarious like love is war or Konosuba. Nonetheless its a great show and if u have nothing else to do I suggest you check it out :<3 7.5/10",spoilerswotaku ni koi wa muzukashii anime let get right chase pretty generic pretty much one humble cute anime binge rainy day partial comedy slice life impactful episode anime came spring make reletively new essentially girl get new job new city japan shes closet otaku love anime even creates yaoi hentai low go new job end meeting old friend middle schoolwho used game lot dude like super otaku game time end catching becoming friend also turn people happen couple also otakus basically become friend dude girl start date like damn fuck anyway basically cute little story dissapoint nothing else watch also opening literally one greatest ever listened seen swear u see opening watch animation cute die mention song good easily top ops song capturing seek capture get solid funny cute nice opening would call impactful like hilarious like love war konosuba nonetheless great show u nothing else suggest check,positive,0.2410278379028379,0.5977934102934103
Just watched the last episode!I started watching it pretty much after reading the synopsis. Animes with otakus are fun to watch for me. Especially because while watching it at times I think thatsss sooo meee! xD Wotakoi didnt dissapoint me.In Wotakoi we follow the story of 4 otaku friends. But whats really refreshing about it isss they are not in highschool but already in their late 20s and working!The characters are all different and that makes it interesting. Hirotaka is a hardcore otaku kinda xD but he is also very cute. He defenetely wants to show his affection but sometimes its hard since Narumi...sees him more like a friend and misunderstands things he does.I enjoyed watching it. And the opening music suits the anime quite well.^^Now my overeall score is 7 for the simple reason that since the MCs are adults and this is a romance anime you might asume that you see more relationship stuff happening than in highschool animes. But no... Ofcourse there were romantic moments and really cute ones that is but just not enough. I wanted to see more romance going on. And a lil bit more character developement. And also there was one little thing left open in the last episode :PSo thats why I didnt give an 8. But Wotakoi was fun to watch and the story was simple but nice.^^,watched last episodei started watching pretty much reading synopsis anime otakus fun watch especially watching time think thatsss sooo meee xd wotakoi didnt dissapoint mein wotakoi follow story otaku friend whats really refreshing isss highschool already late workingthe character different make interesting hirotaka hardcore otaku kinda xd also cute defenetely want show affection sometimes hard since narumisees like friend misunderstands thing doesi enjoyed watching opening music suit anime quite wellnow overeall score simple reason since mc adult romance anime might asume see relationship stuff happening highschool anime ofcourse romantic moment really cute one enough wanted see romance going lil bit character developement also one little thing left open last episode pso thats didnt give wotakoi fun watch story simple nice,positive,0.14461805555555554,0.528720238095238
"It's cute and different (being a story about otakus) but you can get bored very fast. It's not intense in a typical sense. Usually the thrill of romcom animes is the build-up or the tension in the air lets say but I don't get the same feeling from it. The main dude feels like a robot at time yeah, there is a lack of expression that makes him feel unrealistic at times. It's pretty mediocre. Also, in some scenes you can definitely tell that the animation budget for this was quite low or rushed as there are a few seconds total in the episodes where...a frame is kept still for longer then needed.",cute different story otakus get bored fast intense typical sense usually thrill romcom anime buildup tension air let say dont get feeling main dude feel like robot time yeah lack expression make feel unrealistic time pretty mediocre also scene definitely tell animation budget quite low rushed second total episode wherea frame kept still longer needed,negative,-0.04,0.6555555555555556
"""New workplace, new me. I won't let anyone find out that I am a hopeless otaku! Yes, I have changed my wallpaper to something normal."" No, this is not you but our shujinkō(主人公) Momose Narumi who is a fujoshi or a yaoi fangirl.This story is about a girl who doesn't want her colleagues to find out that she is into BL even after becoming a part of working society. The twist is ,of course, when she mistakenly bumps into her childhood friend, Nifuji Hirotaka, who knows about her ""hobby"" in the same workplace.""First mission assignment, silence Hirotaka."" And of course our Hirotaka is dense and...emotionless which is opposite to Momose's personality.The story develops into something more interesting in each episode and slowly they find other colleagues with same type of hobbies. They interact and become friendly enough to talk about it.The story progression is somewhat special because rather than character development, what's more observable is that the characters are opening up to eachother which in my opinion isn't character development. Pacing of story is not to fast or too slow but isn't exactly comfortable either. It's something difficult to explain the pacing so watch for yourself to understand it.The character setting is really fantastic. First, we have Nifuji, a game otaku.Next, we have a fudanshi(though he never refers to himself as that in whole series), the guy who loves Yuri, Kabakura Tarou.And lastly, a comrade of Momose, who's also into BL and a cosplayer, Koyanagi Hanako.The best part about this character setting could be seen in later episodes when other people from workplace were shown and their views about them.For me Kabakura-senpai was simply the best not because he and I share the same interest but because his VA is Sugita Tomokazu. Sugita-san is also VA of Gintoki.The animation was what would be expected but it wasn't anything notable. Could say it was decent. The representation was somewhat appreciable since there were a lot of references from famous anime and to games both directly and also in background so look out for them in anime. I especially loved the scenes where they would play online games and their game avatars would look like them.Special MentionI truly liked the character Nifuji Naoya, younger brother of Hirotaka. His presence itself was heartwarming and his VA was just as amazing as the character.This was my first office anime so I am not sure if I will find something better than this in genre but I truly enjoyed it and don't think it will change in future.All in all, I really enjoyed watching this and would totally recommend you to watch this especially otakus who are contributing to society.",new workplace new wont let anyone find hopeless otaku yes changed wallpaper something normal shujink momose narumi fujoshi yaoi fangirlthis story girl doesnt want colleague find bl even becoming part working society twist course mistakenly bump childhood friend nifuji hirotaka know hobby workplacefirst mission assignment silence hirotaka course hirotaka dense andemotionless opposite momos personalitythe story develops something interesting episode slowly find colleague type hobby interact become friendly enough talk itthe story progression somewhat special rather character development whats observable character opening eachother opinion isnt character development pacing story fast slow isnt exactly comfortable either something difficult explain pacing watch understand itthe character setting really fantastic first nifuji game otakunext fudanshithough never refers whole series guy love yuri kabakura tarouand lastly comrade momose who also bl cosplayer koyanagi hanakothe best part character setting could seen later episode people workplace shown view themfor kabakurasenpai simply best share interest va sugita tomokazu sugitasan also va gintokithe animation would expected wasnt anything notable could say decent representation somewhat appreciable since lot reference famous anime game directly also background look anime especially loved scene would play online game game avatar would look like themspecial mentioni truly liked character nifuji naoya younger brother hirotaka presence heartwarming va amazing characterthis first office anime sure find something better genre truly enjoyed dont think change futureall really enjoyed watching would totally recommend watch especially otakus contributing society,positive,0.21360801896516182,0.540938294509723
"I stumbled upon Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashi in my search for my first romance anime that deviated from using drama or comedy as a cause for infatuation between characters. Because frankly, watching so many relationships start from dramatic events or simply because ""why not"" felt like a tiresome repeating event after a while. After a while, I thought ""Man, these people have no actual common interests shared between them, just plot induced drama, this relationship ain't gonna actually last"". And in being in a relationship myself and being ""forced"" to see thing from a different perspective, very little anime had hit that spot of...relatability that I longed for. The age difference of the characters of this anime compared to everything else I saw was a good enough promise that this anime what what I wanted to see.There are two main differences that makes this anime stand out and they are fairly simple ones. The age of the characters and the focus on a different part of the relationship other than the ""leading up to it"". We have 4 characters split into two couples, all in their mid-late 20s, working office jobs. One couple is still in its infancy and the other which while not stated, is going on for about 8-9 years minimum. Already, feels pretty fresh compared to most others. And the show capitalizes on that by focusing mostly on these two couples and their interactions. (There is a third couple developing, but since it wasn't fully realized it wont be mentioned. It's a shame, as I feel, it was a real wasted opportunity to add a third party of a younger relationship-to-be still trying to figure stuff out ALONGSIDE the others would have had a nice contrast).Character wise, splitting the cast again by couples, we have care-free Narumi and silent Hirotoka, and on the other side we have the two headstrong Hanako and Kabakura. As if by MERE CHANCE, the two personalities are made to be complete opposites while the other two to mirror each other (at least, it's what it seems at first). They all have the ""otaku lifestyle"" as a common denominator, though the show goes out of its way to prove that even that isn't a simple tag you can put on someone and instantly say you are a match. Again, deliberate choices in my opinion to flesh out these otherwise stale tropes of typical otaku. While on the subject of characters specifically, I wanna focus on Hirotoka, as he is given a lot more backstory and character motivation. While this could have been a hinderance to the show and its tone, I feel personally that it is done beautifully. Despite what he may give off in the beginning (silent, cool, maybe boring and predictable main protagonist), he is what I would describe as a near perfect representation of the type of character he is trying to represent. Not awkward, easily flustered or anti social man, but just a person that is less outward emotionally. He is still very proactive, even more than the Narumi at first, being the one to make the first move and the one to try and address the problems that begin to arise. He genuinely cares and tries for the relationship in his own way. And the backstory he is given just adds a lot onto that and, in my opinion, make him very relatable, more so than other characters of his type in anime. I'd honestly rank him as one of my favorite anime characters (not really a big list but STILL). I don't wanna get too much more into it, since spoiling more would spoil a lot of the show and its great character moments.Broadening the scope again, the great moments don't stop there. Since the show is slice of life, it jumps from one character interaction to the next and they are for the most part solid. I guess, you could say that it has it easy, not having to build an actual story, but I have yet to see many anime hit that same note of relatability in some aspects of relationships. Focusing on the more mature couple to begin with, I have seen many people just describe it as toxic. Obviously they have had little experience in what relationship actually are. We are talking about two people who 've know each other from high school and stayed together till present day while working at the same job on top of that. Merely imaging how hard that would be gives me chills. I guess many have only seen cute moments of relationships as reference, but in reality, being in one, especially for that long, you are going to be subject to a lot of fighting even about trivial things. Things like wanting to share some more interests of the other person (even somewhat forcefully), just spending quality time together, or even wondering if all this time together was spent for nothing and the other person simply tolerated you for this long. I have never seen an anime (again to be clear, that is a very short list) portray these problems before. And it's because you can actually see all these bad times, that the sweet moments hit all the better. Jumping to the newer couple, the anime takes very much the same steps to feel real and relatable. Questioning what the other person is actually thinking, since you 've yet to know him well, comparing with previous relationships, having a hard time figuring how to spend quality time together after wearing down the one thing that connected you. Even having awkward intimate moments (more than once with no ""ok we got it now"" the next second), and it is played more for the real moment it is rather than just a joke. Things like worry, jealousy, awkwardness even fear is present in all characters regardless of their personality. It's honestly really refreshing to see.Looking to the more technical production side of things, animation and music. Truthfully, there is nothing to right about. Animation is mediocre with no really amazing shots and visual comedy through smart animation is kept at a minimum. Music, other than that damn catchy opening, is again nothing to write home about. I barely noticed the music and going back to actually pay attention to it, I wasn't really impressed. As always, it's a really shame to see, especially in the music department, but I didn't feel like it hurt the show, so I am just going to leave it at that.I left this last part for...last.. because it's more of a personal thing (MORE SO THAN THE REST OF THIS REVIEW, I guess). I didn't start watching this show because of the otaku couples, it wasn't what personally drove me to watch it. And many mentioned anime characters, I had to google, and many reference mentioned probably flew over my head. It was more of an ""cute couples do cute things"" ™ show for me. The common interest was just that, an interest the characters shared. Compared to them, I d probably be considered a ""Naoya"". And I feel like that's completely fine. For me, it was more about the couples than the common interest they had and the show I feel does try to nudge you into that direction, showing how even they, had trouble agreeing on things or sharing the more specific aspects of ""being nerdy"". Going through the recommendations for this show, most people choose to associate this show with others mostly with otaku relationships. Personally, I do not think that this is the main selling point of this anime and it's rather than a hook to get more people to see it.To leave with an ending note, I really liked like the show. I rated it higher than many others on my list because of how relatable and fresh it felt. Many others probably will not feel this way or might enjoy this show for some other respectable reasons. Either way, I feel like it's a rather underrated little anime, that most should watch to get a more real, but still ""cute and fluffy"" view of what relationships entail.",stumbled upon wotaku ni koi wa muzukashi search first romance anime deviated using drama comedy cause infatuation character frankly watching many relationship start dramatic event simply felt like tiresome repeating event thought man people actual common interest shared plot induced drama relationship aint gon na actually last relationship forced see thing different perspective little anime hit spot ofrelatability longed age difference character anime compared everything else saw good enough promise anime wanted seethere two main difference make anime stand fairly simple one age character focus different part relationship leading character split two couple midlate working office job one couple still infancy stated going year minimum already feel pretty fresh compared others show capitalizes focusing mostly two couple interaction third couple developing since wasnt fully realized wont mentioned shame feel real wasted opportunity add third party younger relationshiptobe still trying figure stuff alongside others would nice contrastcharacter wise splitting cast couple carefree narumi silent hirotoka side two headstrong hanako kabakura mere chance two personality made complete opposite two mirror least seems first otaku lifestyle common denominator though show go way prove even isnt simple tag put someone instantly say match deliberate choice opinion flesh otherwise stale trope typical otaku subject character specifically wan na focus hirotoka given lot backstory character motivation could hinderance show tone feel personally done beautifully despite may give beginning silent cool maybe boring predictable main protagonist would describe near perfect representation type character trying represent awkward easily flustered anti social man person less outward emotionally still proactive even narumi first one make first move one try address problem begin arise genuinely care try relationship way backstory given add lot onto opinion make relatable character type anime id honestly rank one favorite anime character really big list still dont wan na get much since spoiling would spoil lot show great character momentsbroadening scope great moment dont stop since show slice life jump one character interaction next part solid guess could say easy build actual story yet see many anime hit note relatability aspect relationship focusing mature couple begin seen many people describe toxic obviously little experience relationship actually talking two people know high school stayed together till present day working job top merely imaging hard would give chill guess many seen cute moment relationship reference reality one especially long going subject lot fighting even trivial thing thing like wanting share interest person even somewhat forcefully spending quality time together even wondering time together spent nothing person simply tolerated long never seen anime clear short list portray problem actually see bad time sweet moment hit better jumping newer couple anime take much step feel real relatable questioning person actually thinking since yet know well comparing previous relationship hard time figuring spend quality time together wearing one thing connected even awkward intimate moment ok got next second played real moment rather joke thing like worry jealousy awkwardness even fear present character regardless personality honestly really refreshing seelooking technical production side thing animation music truthfully nothing right animation mediocre really amazing shot visual comedy smart animation kept minimum music damn catchy opening nothing write home barely noticed music going back actually pay attention wasnt really impressed always really shame see especially music department didnt feel like hurt show going leave thati left last part forlast personal thing rest review guess didnt start watching show otaku couple wasnt personally drove watch many mentioned anime character google many reference mentioned probably flew head cute couple cute thing show common interest interest character shared compared probably considered naoya feel like thats completely fine couple common interest show feel try nudge direction showing even trouble agreeing thing sharing specific aspect nerdy going recommendation show people choose associate show others mostly otaku relationship personally think main selling point anime rather hook get people see itto leave ending note really liked like show rated higher many others list relatable fresh felt many others probably feel way might enjoy show respectable reason either way feel like rather underrated little anime watch get real still cute fluffy view relationship entail,positive,0.09939553990610327,0.44381790744466787
"Honestly when I was younger in life and I found myself watching this anime it didn't really make a connection with me. I just thought it was boring, but watching it now as I've matured in my anime taste and having my understanding of what a bad and good anime is, I've realised now how amazingly good this anime is. I like how the character grow closer together at there own pace. I've watched countless rom-coms and the way most of them have the character kissing and almost doing the deed by the end of 12ep is kinda cringe and over sexualised. Like sure it...works out for some anime but it feels too rushy and I dislike it. Now that being said if its too long then it's kind of a bummer.Now I know many people would go and say this was boring well I would say there flawed in the views. I feel like you really need to come in watching this with a good type of mindset. The mindset of a realistic human, like most of the time these days people rush things like get married to soon and then break up. But instead if you really took the time to get to know the person and not have to rely on borderline sexual activity's to boost the connect with them.Sure its nice to have physical contact every so often but that's not what makes a relationship work. Its being there for each other, having that trust, that bond and being able to have fun no matter what you see as fun as long as your having fun. That's what I'd say this anime did a spectacular job at doing and its a good breather from a lot of other media shows (anime and regular main steam media) where they feel like its necessary to have sexual scenes, like me as a 20 year adult I just find myself skipping more and more of those kissing/sexual scenes, I just find it boring and awkward and its not always needed, YES there are times for them but its not what makes a rom-com exciting for me.ALSO the ova was great too so go watch that if you haven't. I just wish they put out more seasons. I'm probably going to read the manga if there is one.",honestly younger life found watching anime didnt really make connection thought boring watching ive matured anime taste understanding bad good anime ive realised amazingly good anime like character grow closer together pace ive watched countless romcoms way character kissing almost deed end ep kinda cringe sexualised like sure itworks anime feel rushy dislike said long kind bummernow know many people would go say boring well would say flawed view feel like really need come watching good type mindset mindset realistic human like time day people rush thing like get married soon break instead really took time get know person rely borderline sexual activity boost connect themsure nice physical contact every often thats make relationship work trust bond able fun matter see fun long fun thats id say anime spectacular job good breather lot medium show anime regular main steam medium feel like necessary sexual scene like year adult find skipping kissingsexual scene find boring awkward always needed yes time make romcom exciting mealso ovum great go watch havent wish put season im probably going read manga one,positive,0.14429824561403506,0.5429912923333976
"The story is very mediocre. Not a whole lot happens throughout the anime and they don't really change much. They introduced new characters throughout the anime, drawing away time from the main 2 characters Narumi and Hirotaka which I found annoying.  I do wish it was longer or the focus was much more on Narumi and Hirotaka's relationship, but I suppose this anime isn't so much for me then.Narumi and Hirotaka had the most elaborate characters, and their backstories are the best, yet they didn't dwell on it and half of the screen time was on other characters.When the story starts getting good,...the anime ends, kind of disappointing really.However it is very easy to watch so I can't complain too much.Art style is good, it's my preferred style of art.

So I decided to watch anime.Wotakoi (with only 11 episodes) was a pleasant surprise.It is a very nice show with warm atmosphere and humour.

"I've been watching a lot of Shonen these days and wanted a change. Therefore, I looked for some wholesome romance and comedy. Wotakoi is exactly this.Without a coherent plot(as the opening says), you can pretty much jump into any episode and enjoy it. I in fact did this when I accidentally watched EP10 after EP1. Wotakoi is a bunch of fun stories to get absorbed into. I usually don't like episodic shows, but Wotakoi nailed it from start to finish.‎The characters and their dynamics are super fun. I loved the contrast between Hana and Kabakura's relationship and Hirotaka and Momose's. They all have distinct personalities...and enjoy different otaku things. which creates many fun moments.‎ Hirotaka is undoubtedly my favorite character, maybe because he is really the only one that got any characterization beyond his hobbies and appearance. I'm disappointed we couldn't see just a bit more from him tho, feels like wasted potential.It handled its romance in a great way, and it was super refreshing to see adult romance instead of high school teens. No one getting all red all the time and misunderstandings get resolved on the spot, instead of the characters not talking to each other for a week. I'll admit that Hana and Kabakura's relationship had me questioning whether it's healthy at times, but eventually, they got a ""redemption arc.""Wotakoi will make you feel warm and lovesick. Whenever the main characters had a tender moment, you would catch me smiling ear to ear and daydreaming.One thing that can be weird about Wotakoi is the two leading female characters imagining Yaoi with their boyfriends. Tho I guess this isn't out of the ordinary for fans of this genre.The art and music were great, that opening is iconic! I especially enjoyed the backgrounds, so kudos to whoever worked on them. The fun little things they did to make the anime seem like an interactive game made me laugh so much while watching. And the, as I like calling them, ""ID cards"" they showed during the ad breaks were yet another creative decision. The animation was mind-blowing for a romcom, and the opening alone can show you that. Gotta thank the hardworking people at A1 Pictures for that.Wotakoi is fun, romantic, and wholesome. It made me laugh with splendid comedy, that felt natural. Who would have thought a show about office romance between otakus can be so endearing? I heartily recommend it.‎",ive watching lot shonen day wanted change therefore looked wholesome romance comedy wotakoi exactly thiswithout coherent plotas opening say pretty much jump episode enjoy fact accidentally watched ep ep wotakoi bunch fun story get absorbed usually dont like episodic show wotakoi nailed start finishthe character dynamic super fun loved contrast hana kabakuras relationship hirotaka momos distinct personalitiesand enjoy different otaku thing creates many fun moment hirotaka undoubtedly favorite character maybe really one got characterization beyond hobby appearance im disappointed couldnt see bit tho feel like wasted potentialit handled romance great way super refreshing see adult romance instead high school teen one getting red time misunderstanding get resolved spot instead character talking week ill admit hana kabakuras relationship questioning whether healthy time eventually got redemption arcwotakoi make feel warm lovesick whenever main character tender moment would catch smiling ear ear daydreamingone thing weird wotakoi two leading female character imagining yaoi boyfriend tho guess isnt ordinary fan genrethe art music great opening iconic especially enjoyed background kudos whoever worked fun little thing make anime seem like interactive game made laugh much watching like calling id card showed ad break yet another creative decision animation mindblowing romcom opening alone show got ta thank hardworking people picture thatwotakoi fun romantic wholesome made laugh splendid comedy felt natural would thought show office romance otakus endearing heartily recommend,positive,0.22978333333333334,0.4918

"Sad that it did not live up to the promise of the title. Descended into a workplace romcom with trivial otaku references. Ignored the promising material of exploring the con scene, aspiring artists & writers all while holding day jobs. I can see lots more interesting plots that could be done. Dress-up Darling was much better and recommended over this.The negotiation between Koyanagi & Kabakura of their contrasting interests would have been fun to watch & the side plot of Nifuji Naoya & Sakuragi Ko felt more like filler.Loved the intro though.

"Story - 7Let's start with the pros. First off, this story is very relatable to the average otaku (or just straight up geek). The setting is also unique and gives a charm to the show since it is one of the few I've seen outside of a school settings. As well, this was extremely captivating. However, there is only one downside. The story is more episodic, but the cons are outnumbered by the various pros.Art - 9Starting with the intro visuals, they were colorful, impressive, and fun... very fun. The dance in the opening is addictive and fun (as I said), I caught myself practicing...what they do every single episode. Throughout the show, the animation is consistent without any major complaints. The references to other shows (such as the JoJO's reference) adds to the charm and mood of the show. Also, the ""isekai"" episodes gave a fun twist and contrast to the usual animation. The only minor complaint I have about the animation are the 3D crowd scenes. In the backgrounds the people have 3D walking animations and it's a tiny bit weird. It wasn't bad enough to knock the art down to a 8 or 7 though.Sound - 10No complaints. The voice acting was so so so good. Simple as that. There is no voice in English that could compete with the Japanese voice actors. The intro and outro music, outstanding, I even added it to my playlist after the first episode. The rest of the OST was catchy and vibey. Perfection.Character - 9The 4 main characters are well written and relatable (as I mentioned before). Out of the 4 main characters you have to relate to at least one of them in some major way. IF you're an otaku/geek the characters will make a lot more sense (meaning don't watch this as a normie/with normies). However, Nao was not it. I wasn't a very big fan to be honest. He kinda ruined the vibe being a normie and a college student, since the rest of the cast were adults. A final minor complaint, was how for the majority of the show, the characters rarely changed color schemes.Enjoyment - 10Even though there were slight flaws, this show was so hype and mood lifting. The comedy and sarcasm throughout the entire show was great. The side couple, Hana and Kabakura, were definitely the comedic highlights of the show. Nifuji was a solo comedian, and it made it even better that he wasn't purposely being funny. The intro got me boppin everytime, caught myself dancing, and singing. I want more. This is the first solely romance based anime I've wanted more of. Dark, horror, and psychological is usually my taste, however this shed a new light on romance that I never had before.Overall - 9Overall I highly recommend this to any otakus. Up till now it is the best romance I've seen. You WILL learn the dance.

"This isn't a romance anime in the traditional shoujo sense. Although their lives are revolved around otaku culture, this is a more ""mature"" romance portrayed in a fun. Hirotaka and Narumi don't take themselves too seriously, unless it's otaku related, which is fun to watch. Of course there are a few ""serious"" moments between the two, but I think the charming point of this anime is that it's not super serious. I was constantly laughing throughout the anime. I know some people don't like that there wasn't an overwhelming amount of PDA between either couple, but I personally had no problem with it. There were...a few times where I was screaming for Hirotaka to grab Narumi's hand or for Kabakura to pop the question to Hana, but I think that's what also makes the anime realistic. Not every couple is super lovey-dovey like shoujo animes portray. Some couples start off slow and build up to it and that's Hirotaka and Narumi. This anime doesn't necessarily have a ""point"" to the plot, but not all anime need one to be fun to watch.

"WotaKoi : Love is Hard for Otaku is a good romance comedy. I really enjoyed this anime. It was very wholesome and I laughed a lot about the jokes. The characters are well written and they all have their own personality, what I really like because that is very important for all kind of shows. Also the drawings are one of my favorite and the sounds fit good to the scenes.The only this I missed was a good plot. The story did not have a real detailed plot and that is what I really love if I watch a anime. The two main characters are...childhood friends who are gonna date but there is more a friendly relationship than a love relationship. I was also a little bit dissapointed at the last episode because there is not a real ending. I don't know if there is gonna be a season 2 (I really hope there is gonna be a season 2) but if there is going to be a season 2, I will definitly watch it and I hope it gets more plot.",wotakoi love hard otaku good romance comedy really enjoyed anime wholesome laughed lot joke character well written personality really like important kind show also drawing one favorite sound fit good scenesthe missed good plot story real detailed plot really love watch anime two main character arechildhood friend gon na date friendly relationship love relationship also little bit dissapointed last episode real ending dont know gon na season really hope gon na season going season definitly watch hope get plot,positive,0.3801136363636364,0.5382575757575757
"This was a very cute, funny and short anime to watch. It wasn't the best but definitely enjoyable if you're looking for something to snack on. I love the simple concept where two otakus fall in love and that her friends/coworkers also like similar things, but can also accept each other's different tastes. And the thing that made me the show likeable is the number of easter eggs and many relatable scenarios for us anime/game/cosplay nerds out there.Despite all these good things however, thats pretty much all there is to it. Some of the romantic scenes felt pretty underwhelming and it felt like half...of the show simply wanted to focus more on the nerd and spend way less time on the characters' development. I'm glad to see everyone's backstory, but I also want to see more of how the character grow with each other. But then again this season only had 11 episodes and based on the ending and the ""mattane"", I'm assuming and hoping that there will be a second season. However, since it is now 2020, I'm not expecting too much. SOI guess I'll go read the manga~",cute funny short anime watch wasnt best definitely enjoyable youre looking something snack love simple concept two otakus fall love friendscoworkers also like similar thing also accept others different taste thing made show likeable number easter egg many relatable scenario u animegamecosplay nerd theredespite good thing however thats pretty much romantic scene felt pretty underwhelming felt like halfof show simply wanted focus nerd spend way less time character development im glad see everyones backstory also want see character grow season episode based ending mattane im assuming hoping second season however since im expecting much soi guess ill go read manga,positive,0.2373015873015873,0.5705215419501133
"Ok ok, maybe I'm biased. But let me start my review by saying this: I don't give away 10 stars so easily. I'm actually very picky. Most of my 10s are from a few shows from my childhood (nostalgia is a thing that affects all of us, don't you deny it!) and some are from shows that I actually, legitimately, truly loved.And boy oh boy, did I reeeeaaaally love Wotakoi.While it doesn't exactly have a linear plot (I guess it follows more of a ""slice of life episodic"" formula), the cast more than makes up for it. We have a fujoshi that doesn't want her...secret to come out to normies, a hardcore gamer who doesn't care what other people think of him 'cause he's pretty much antisocial, a cosplayer who's also a fujoshi and who mostly cosplays as male characters and a mild otaku who's not that into the weird spectrum of ""otakuness"" [except for lolis and yuri. he's VERY MUCH into that.]And those are just the 4 main characters, I could spoil a bit and talk about the others but I'll let you watch it and meet them yourselves instead ;)So. These four work together in a firm and become really close friends and THAT'S where the story really begins. Two of them were already dating but the other two start dating at the beginning of the story and it's really cute and funny to compare these two couples and see how different their dynamics is.This anime deals with the awkwardness of being an otaku and trying to date with someone who is/isn't a part of your circle of interest. It deals with the friendships that you can find if only you open up a little bit and show other people your interests and see what their interests are like, too. It deals with light themes (""haha wouldn't it be funny if our boyfriends fucked each other? BUT MY BOYFRIEND IS TOTALLY A TOP! YOURS IS A BOTTOM!"") and dark themes (""hmm i think i'm gonna get my ears pierced just so I can get the attention of my childhood friend who I have this major crush on""). And so on...True, it does deliver more comedy than romance. If you're looking for kissing, romantic confessions and such... hmmm... maybe this isn't exactly the anime for you. But it will definitely melt your heart and put a smile on your face, for sure.Another downside is that it's so SHORT. Only 11 episodes, 23 minutes each. But even so, I think it's a sweet, short ride that's worth getting on.",ok ok maybe im biased let start review saying dont give away star easily im actually picky show childhood nostalgia thing affect u dont deny show actually legitimately truly lovedand boy oh boy reeeeaaaally love wotakoiwhile doesnt exactly linear plot guess follows slice life episodic formula cast make fujoshi doesnt want hersecret come normies hardcore gamer doesnt care people think cause he pretty much antisocial cosplayer who also fujoshi mostly cosplays male character mild otaku who weird spectrum otakuness except lolis yuri he much thatand main character could spoil bit talk others ill let watch meet instead four work together firm become really close friend thats story really begin two already dating two start dating beginning story really cute funny compare two couple see different dynamic isthis anime deal awkwardness otaku trying date someone isisnt part circle interest deal friendship find open little bit show people interest see interest like deal light theme haha wouldnt funny boyfriend fucked boyfriend totally top bottom dark theme hmm think im gon na get ear pierced get attention childhood friend major crush ontrue deliver comedy romance youre looking kissing romantic confession hmmm maybe isnt exactly anime definitely melt heart put smile face sureanother downside short episode minute even think sweet short ride thats worth getting,positive,0.12884615384615386,0.46794871794871795
"Girl, DTMFA and find someone better  - he's either got diagnosable intimacy/social anxiety issues you can't help him with or is just asexual. Either way you can do better and find someone who will fulfill you romantically and sexually and who you will not have to mother as a way of gaining any sort of attention or intimacy.People praise this for featuring adults, these are not adults. They act like platonic friends and not even particularly close ones. In any other romcom the main guy would be the villain, the romantically useless boring guy the main character realises she needs to dump because he...can fulfill none of her needs emotionally or sexually.I initially quite liked it, 6 out of 10 and quite watchable if nothing special. However in episode 10 I realised I'd completely misread the situation. I assumed when at the end of the first or second episode she stayed over and they were in pajamas in bed and there was an awkward accident that led to a kiss. I assumed that broke the ice and after that they had sex and it was behind closed doors but broadly they were having sex. I mean she's staying over in his room loads in this show. I didn't realise when they said sleepover they meant sleepover like teenagers have, I assumed it was a euphemism. They are in their late 20s!But oh no. The big thing in episode 11 is he goes to hold her hand for the first time after months of dating, and wimps out.I though cause japan and manga can be a bit funny about sex in certain publications you definitely have to read between the lines and broadly it's going on but just not part of the story.

"English.I think that the word to describe this anime is: ""Meh"", I think that the concept that it shows us of love between people who like geeky things is quite interesting, but its realization sins of being boring and of not fully delving into its characters .The story is very simple and I think that the development of the couples is not completely specified, in addition to being a bit mediocre, since the two couples shown (later three) do not feel like true couples, the first of the blue-haired one with the one of Rosa feels like a friendship relationship more than anything else, the...second one of the orange-haired girl and the green-haired girl keep fighting throughout the anime for no really logical reason, then there comes a point where you don't believe them to be couple although sometimes they can behave as such.The story is episodic and we don't have a specific objective in all the anime, that means that you only watch the episodes to see them and don't give them so much importance, I think if you like this type of anime you'll love this one, If not, I don't think it's necessary or I don't recommend that you see it, there are better alternatives in the love genre and with the same geek theme.Español.Creo que la palabra para describir este anime es: “Meh”, creo que el concepto que nos muestra del amor entre personas que les gusta las cosas geeks es bastante interesante pero su realización peca de ser aburrida y de no profundizar por completo en sus personajes.La historia es muy simple y creo que el desarrollo de las parejas no se concreto por completo además de ser un poco mediocre, ya que las dos parejas mostradas (posteriormente tres) no se sienten como verdaderas parejas la primera del de pelo azul con la de rosa se siente como una relación de amistad más que otra cosa, la segunda del de pelo naranja y la chica de pelo verde se la pasan peleando en todo el anime sin algún motivo verdaderamente lógico, entonces llega un punto en que no les crees que sean pareja aunque a veces se pueden comportar como tal.La historia es episódica y no tenemos un objetivo en concreto en todo el anime, eso hace que solo veas los episodios por verlos y que no les tomes tanta importancia a estos, creo que si te gustan este tipo de animes te va a encantar este, sino creo que no es necesario o no te recomiendo que lo veas, hay mejores alternativas en el género de amor y con la misma temática de geeks.",englishi think word describe anime meh think concept show u love people like geeky thing quite interesting realization sin boring fully delving character story simple think development couple completely specified addition bit mediocre since two couple shown later three feel like true couple first bluehaired one one rosa feel like friendship relationship anything else thesecond one orangehaired girl greenhaired girl keep fighting throughout anime really logical reason come point dont believe couple although sometimes behave suchthe story episodic dont specific objective anime mean watch episode see dont give much importance think like type anime youll love one dont think necessary dont recommend see better alternative love genre geek themeespaolcreo que la palabra para describir este anime e meh creo que el concepto que no muestra del amor entre persona que le gusta la cosas geek e bastante interesante pero su realizacin peca de ser aburrida de profundizar por completo en sus personajesla historia e muy simple creo que el desarrollo de la parejas se concreto por completo adems de ser un poco mediocre ya que la do parejas mostradas posteriormente tres se sienten como verdaderas parejas la primera del de pelo azul con la de rosa se siente como una relacin de amistad m que otra cosa la segunda del de pelo naranja la chica de pelo verde se la pasan peleando en todo el anime sin algn motivo verdaderamente lgico entonces llega un punto en que le cree que sean pareja aunque veces se pueden comportar como talla historia e episdica tenemos un objetivo en concreto en todo el anime eso hace que solo veas los episodios por verlos que le tome tanta importancia estos creo que si te gustan este tipo de anime te va encantar este sino creo que e necesario te recomiendo que lo veas hay mejores alternativas en el gnero de amor con la misma temtica de geek,positive,0.06687499999999999,0.5130059523809524
"Growing up from a kid to adulthood, I’m sure all of us has our own favorite hobbies, interests, or dirty little secret. Not many people like to admit it but it’s part of our society and how we live in. For a show about the otaku culture and exploring the lifestyle of the nerd norm, Wotake ni Koi wa Muzukashii really set the bar high. Welcome to a world where office romance, otakuism, and gaming culture become an experience you won’t forget.The English translation title is “It’s Difficult to Love an Otaku” and “Love is Hard of Otaku”. Literally, those words mushed up together already...feels like the show is a big joke or satire. While the show seems like it’s taking a risk at mixing a variety of questionable gimmicks together, I can say safely that there’s no need to worry. As a fan of the manga, I was thrilled to learn that Noitamina was chosen to air this show. It seems fitting for such an anime based on their history of lineups. What’s more is that this show also portrays a more realistic slice of life story that you don’t see too often these days. To me, this was a God-sent gift for Spring 2018.I’m not going to lie. Watching this anime reminds me of being a kid despite the show being targeted at an older audience. The goofy style of the storytelling along with the colorful character cast brings in a very playful atmosphere. Even as the show takes place in an office life environment, it’s hard to ignore the character chemistry between the main cast. From the start, we got two childhood friends named Narumi Momose and Hirotaka Nifuji. The two have known each other for awhile but are almost like complete polar opposites. Narumi is a bubbly outgoing girl with an interest in fujoshi and otome games. On the other hand, Nifuji is an otaku with an avid interest in video games and doesn’t actually seem to care what other thinks of him. Despite their different personalities, it’s undeniable that the two has chemistry both during and off work. The other two lovebirds in the show consists of Hanako Koanagi and Tarou Kabakura. They are dating as a couple and while the two constantly bickers at every chance they get, the two genuinely seems to love each other. Now, you’re probably thinking…is this going to be a show filled with drama and misunderstandings? Absolutely not. While the show contains office romance, it’s hardly a story that focuses on that exclusively. Instead, this anime stands out as a way of exploring the everyday adventures of these characters.One of the primary factors that makes this show appealing is the small character cast. It capitalizes on giving every character a chance to shine without leaving another in the dust. The couple pair of Narumi and Nifuji is infectiously entertaining to watch. Their character chemistry is shown through their interests that somehow intersects with their daily lives. At the office, the two maintains a professional relationship although they still act casually towards each other. The show explores their relationship development as they understand each other more in their adult lives. This even includes going on dates to the movies or amusement park. While the show adapts their relationship more as a ship tease, I think it’s safe that fans accepts them as a couple. Hanako and Tarou are dating already so the show doesn’t hide the fact that they care for each other. It’s mostly lighthearted romance that relies more on realism to do the storytelling. Office romance isn’t easy to adapt but this anime does that without ever being distracting. Characters act the way humans do while drawing connection to their otaku interests. Each of the main characters has their own interest. (otome games, gamer, cosplaying, bishoujo) As a central theme of the show, it establishes their interest through dialogues, interactions, and references. The show often throws in jokes with characters’ small talk and arguing to sell its comedy. It’s damn entertaining as every character gets their moment of fame. It masterfully matches the pacing of the dialogues that feels very real. The impression those moments bring is an accurate depiction of how co-workers behave. Whenever this nerdy group goes out for a drink, they act like casual adults enjoying life. It brings in the sensation of a rom-com between working adults that leaves me satisfied. Oh and before I forget to mention, give the manga a try too. The anime actually expands on some background content but the manga also feels like its own little world.To be honest, A-1 Pictures is the last studio I would imagine adapting this show. However, the production quality itself is vibrant with colorful character designs. The characters looks distinct between one another with their different hair colors and facial expressions. Character reactions also sell a good deal of the comedy especially whenever Narumi reacts in exaggerated manners. As an anime that focuses on otaku, do expect video game references to be made such as the Nintendo Switch and Monster Hunter. There’s even one episode where the characters are adapted into an RPG setting with very gimmicky video game themes.No fan service? No problem. You have the character dialogues doing the talking and most of it delivers humor in the most harmless ways. Yet at the same time, it’s able to create quality entertainment thanks to the talents of the voice cast. Narumi and Hanako in particular are able to bring out the best out of characters through that with their human personalities. The theme songs are also quite creative with their choreography. Namely, the OP song “Fiction” by Sumika is adorably cute with the body language. Every character in the theme songs stands out with their coordinated movements.With 11 episodes, it felt just enough for this anime to do what it’s intended and that’s to sell its ideas to the audience. It succeeds that thanks to its creative circle of characters and their interests. Otakuism is not something that’s accepted easily as a positive culture norm. In fact, it’s often looked down upon in our society. However, this show presented that in a positive way. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the show is recommendable to just about anyone. A show like this deserves more attention, seriously.",growing kid adulthood im sure u favorite hobby interest dirty little secret many people like admit part society live show otaku culture exploring lifestyle nerd norm wotake ni koi wa muzukashii really set bar high welcome world office romance otakuism gaming culture become experience wont forgetthe english translation title difficult love otaku love hard otaku literally word mushed together alreadyfeels like show big joke satire show seems like taking risk mixing variety questionable gimmick together say safely there need worry fan manga thrilled learn noitamina chosen air show seems fitting anime based history lineup whats show also portrays realistic slice life story dont see often day godsent gift spring im going lie watching anime reminds kid despite show targeted older audience goofy style storytelling along colorful character cast brings playful atmosphere even show take place office life environment hard ignore character chemistry main cast start got two childhood friend named narumi momose hirotaka nifuji two known awhile almost like complete polar opposite narumi bubbly outgoing girl interest fujoshi otome game hand nifuji otaku avid interest video game doesnt actually seem care think despite different personality undeniable two chemistry work two lovebird show consists hanako koanagi tarou kabakura dating couple two constantly bicker every chance get two genuinely seems love youre probably thinkingis going show filled drama misunderstanding absolutely show contains office romance hardly story focus exclusively instead anime stand way exploring everyday adventure charactersone primary factor make show appealing small character cast capitalizes giving every character chance shine without leaving another dust couple pair narumi nifuji infectiously entertaining watch character chemistry shown interest somehow intersects daily life office two maintains professional relationship although still act casually towards show explores relationship development understand adult life even includes going date movie amusement park show adapts relationship ship tease think safe fan accepts couple hanako tarou dating already show doesnt hide fact care mostly lighthearted romance relies realism storytelling office romance isnt easy adapt anime without ever distracting character act way human drawing connection otaku interest main character interest otome game gamer cosplaying bishoujo central theme show establishes interest dialogue interaction reference show often throw joke character small talk arguing sell comedy damn entertaining every character get moment fame masterfully match pacing dialogue feel real impression moment bring accurate depiction coworkers behave whenever nerdy group go drink act like casual adult enjoying life brings sensation romcom working adult leaf satisfied oh forget mention give manga try anime actually expands background content manga also feel like little worldto honest picture last studio would imagine adapting show however production quality vibrant colorful character design character look distinct one another different hair color facial expression character reaction also sell good deal comedy especially whenever narumi reacts exaggerated manner anime focus otaku expect video game reference made nintendo switch monster hunter there even one episode character adapted rpg setting gimmicky video game themesno fan service problem character dialogue talking delivers humor harmless way yet time able create quality entertainment thanks talent voice cast narumi hanako particular able bring best character human personality theme song also quite creative choreography namely op song fiction sumika adorably cute body language every character theme song stand coordinated movementswith episode felt enough anime intended thats sell idea audience succeeds thanks creative circle character interest otakuism something thats accepted easily positive culture norm fact often looked upon society however show presented positive way say without shadow doubt show recommendable anyone show like deserves attention seriously,positive,0.14862058080808074,0.51834859006734
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi for short) is a romance comedy which characters are Otakus (Anime or Game Otakus). It is set in an office setting, featuring 4 main characters (2 couples) that are dating each other. Here in there, you would see direct references to manga, anime, games, and the likes. However, this anime fails to deliver well in both comedy and romance. I think it is important for you to treat this more as a slice of life show featuring otaku couples, as to not give any unmet expectations.The romance in this anime is more of just a setting as it is...hardly explored. It will only occasionally throw in some romantic moments. Meanwhile, the jokes in this anime are rarely funny. I feel like the biggest problem to the comedy is the awful timing. It is really slow at delivering punchlines, making it unfunny at most times. To make it worse, there are sometimes short explanations by the game-sounding-narrator, which further slows down the pace.The characters here are not really outstanding. There's no traits or moments that I feel really stand out from them. Also, even though the couples' relationships might change a little, the characters themselves hardly changes.The background music is one problem I have with this anime. Maybe it's just not my taste, but although there are some good tracks, there are a lot of weird tracks that are just slapped unto an unfitting scene (honestly, I don't think those tracks could fit anywhere).Overall, I think this anime fails to deliver a good romcom. There is only a little romance development and jokes fall flat. This is an anime for watching the daily lives of otaku couples. And that's it, since the only thing this anime got going for it is its relatability for people familiar with the otaku culture.",wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii wotakoi short romance comedy character otakus anime game otakus set office setting featuring main character couple dating would see direct reference manga anime game like however anime fails deliver well comedy romance think important treat slice life show featuring otaku couple give unmet expectationsthe romance anime setting ishardly explored occasionally throw romantic moment meanwhile joke anime rarely funny feel like biggest problem comedy awful timing really slow delivering punchlines making unfunny time make worse sometimes short explanation gamesoundingnarrator slows pacethe character really outstanding there trait moment feel really stand also even though couple relationship might change little character hardly changesthe background music one problem anime maybe taste although good track lot weird track slapped unto unfitting scene honestly dont think track could fit anywhereoverall think anime fails deliver good romcom little romance development joke fall flat anime watching daily life otaku couple thats since thing anime got going relatability people familiar otaku culture,negative,-0.010714285714285735,0.5035714285714286
"I picked up Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii along with 3D Kanojo together back when the show first aired and expected both to be about the same, I gave the former an 8 and the latter a 7 originally if my memory doesn't fail me, and from then on even though both featured otaku (now it's obvious that 3D Kanojo only has one while Wotakoi has it's entire casts as the same but I picked it up together for the same reason) it became clear as day which was fresh garbage and which was the anime that made me dance. Looking at the rating I...think you know what show turned out to be the one that made me dance, yes. This is my review of Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii, ikuze!!!Let's start with some backstory. My last seasonal romance watch was in Summer of 2017, almost exactly three seasons ago, which is shocking because if you know me, I love romance and always strive to watch it in some way or the other but in terms of seasonals I felt tired and stopped focusing on the genre. To reasons obvious to romance fans I felt Spring would be the best season for a romance fan to return to the seasonal genre and found a lot of romance anime to watch, but none, absolutely none made me fall over them as much as I fell over Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii. Not because it's cute, but because it's unique, it's fun, and of course, it's got everything else going for it.I mean, look at it's competition this season (or even the last), what romance anime did we have? Tada-kun started strong but suffered with it's cliche problem shortly after, FranXX continues to be complete garbage in the romance category (and dare I say it every other category), the anime I formerly mentioned, 3D Kanojo almost immediately disappointed me with it's second episode, Grancrest had the same FranXX situation, while Beatless could be considered one slot better than the two mentioned. Leaving us with two romance anime this season that continued to be adored by me, Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii and Akkun To Kanojo. The latter was and still is an enjoyable show but being a short, it can't compare to Wotakoi in the same breath. Why? Read on!First off, it's a fantastic slice of life anime. Wotakoi is how you make a Slice of Life Romance work and I can't find any other examples that bettered it till Winter 2017 (when I first started seasonals) and overall I'm sure it'll rank up in my top 5. Yet again you ask why? Because it knows how to captivate it's watchers with warmth. This brings us to the question, why do we watch romance anime? Many would say that it's because it brings them warmth, and surprise, surprise, Wotakoi gives you that. A cute, warm and fuzzy slice of life anime you can cosy up to whether you're single or with your partner. Even though it's centered on Otakus, it's biggest feature is that there's something for everyone.Everyone will find something in the anime worth relating to and laughing at, and I'm just talking about the normies here, if you're a mild anime watcher or a hardcore one, both parties will find lots and lots to laugh at and references to gloss over with this anime. Be it a Dragon Quest reference, a Final Fantasy reference, a Saekano reference, etc etc. There's lots to list and I don't have enough time to list them all for we must move on to the next best part. The soundtrack. I don't think I need to tell you how popular the Opening is especially with it's dance and there's been countless videos on YouTube (some of which were taken down because Sony Music) showing viewers how the dance is done or how they reacted to this marvelous choreography. And that's not to mention the ED as well. Fantastic, cosy and just a joy to watch, it's an excellent example of a testament to the anime.And we've barely scratched the surface. What else makes the anime so fun? The biggest reason why? THE CHARACTERS! I haven't seen such vibrant AND relatable characters in an anime in a very long time and this was just fabulous. I mean, it makes me wanna write on every character. First off, we didn't get one pairup, we got TWO. Then the interactions, motivations, situations, all made for a really cute yet not over the top anime. It didn't overstep its bounds yet created an environment that only Wotakoi could create and excel in. This isn't a Utopia, this is real life, and the real life says Wotakoi is excellent. Speaking of real life, the wonderful staff who worked on this anime. Having renowned VAs like Sawashiro Miyuki and the legendary Sugita Tomokazu himself, this anime wasn't at all short of talent, and the others too did brilliantly. I never for once felt like the voice actors did a bad job, or that the directing or scripting was bad in any way.I might be sounding like I'm fanboying like crazy but let's just say Wotakoi IS that kind of show. It makes you warm and you're left beaming with happiness. Definitely something I'd call a feel-good show. Oh and, another reason why the anime is so amazing? It's got adults. Not high school kids as the main characters and that gives a LOT of room for different scenarios and even though our lovely cast might seem childish, in the first place, being an otaku is a throwback to childhood anyway. And second, we don't have any blushing game of random meetups and random kisses and random blushes and random etc like most high school anime (I already triggered the FranXX fanboys, don't want another group to come after me so I won't give examples now) because from the very first episode itself, everyone is dating. Yes. You read that right. They're dating from the first episode itself and they're adults and they're Otakus. Reasons enough for why it's so fantastic?Still not convinced? How about I tell you that in spite of having such a unique setup, it handles it excellently? Convinced? I sure do hope you are, because I still have more to say. I haven't even gone to the characters in detail yet! Hirotaka might seem like your dense that you see in most high school romance but NO. Do not underestimate him because he is sharp. I mean, the ending of episode 1 changed my view of him from the get go. Surprised? I was too! He continued to be brilliant like the rest of the cast. Narumi on the other hand is fortunately not a flat female character (I just love making that pun) as we see in some romance anime and much like Hirotaka, is just a joy to watch. She's cute, relatable, and is a perfect matchup for Hirotaka. Then we got the polar opposites, Hana-chan and Gintoki- I mean Bakaku- I mean Kabakura. Both were the most loveable lovebirds and sworn enemies, which was a sharp contrast to Hirotaka and Narumi and offered an excellent balance to the aforementioned pair. Though MAL marked them as Supporting Characters they're very much main characters as well since they're a main focus of the anime too! And that's not to mention the other supporting cast too, they're cute too and the biggest part is that even though they're a supporting cast, the brief moments they feature in were all relatable and enjoyable in their own regard and this was me trying my hardest to describe how lovable the cast is, I can't find the words to describe what I feel to the exact point but this should serve as a somewhat great substitute.STILL NOT CONVINCED? Then I can bring up the last of my cards, the artstyle. Many scorned and scoffed at the name of the studio when they first saw it's synopsis since it was made by A-1 Pictures. A studio that is designed for freelancers. What many realised later was that fortunately this was one of those “once in a blue baboon” situations where they turned out to be good, and I'm talking from the perspective of people who don't like A-1 but are objective critics. Me? Well, much like the other fans, I just enjoyed this. I have liked A-1’s many other works before in particular the Working! series and this just adds on to the fun.Coming back to the topic, it's artstyle was unique, vibrant, cheerful and not to mention adorable. There was just that some thing about it that made it such a joy to look at, whether you're watching it in 1080p, 720p, a CR free subscriber, or the 144p master race (is the show even available in this resolution? Maybe in YouTube). Needless to say it's artstyle is YET another plus point the anime had.It's very very tough to find negatives in this anime and the ones I found were that perhaps it's comedy didn't hit me every single time, though it did usually, I perhaps laughed at least once every episode and just longed for the next week’s episode to come out already and when it did, oh the joy I had.Overall, I don't think I need to point this out, but Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii is a romance anime that you definitely must watch if you're a fan of the genre or are looking for that fun Slice of Life anime to entertain and cosy up to. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this is my pick for Anime of the Year or to the extreme minimum, Romance/SoL of the Year. Romance? Yes. Otaku stuff? Yes, but that isn't too deep for someone to get bored with. End product? Something great that anyone and everyone can watch and enjoy! Yes. Even normies :PYou and I might not see eye to eye on the anime, but I'm sure you'll leave the anime with a smile, that is, if you love watching fun shows. Much like with everyone, you'll definitely find out that you struck a chord with a lot of the things in the anime. I mean, we're all Otakus aren't we?P.S: That last episode man. Incorporated everything that was great in the previous episodes and brought out the best from them to make for a fantastic end to a fantastic anime. If I were to describe Wotakoi in one word, it would ironically be that it's inclusive despite it's otaku centered focus.

"I’m honestly enjoying this anime so much, I look forward to the next episode every week.‘Love is hard for otaku’ to me, is a simple, funny and cute series with some references here and there, displaying the struggles and benefits of relationships between otaku, whether it’s just a friendly relationship or something more.The main characters all have their own characteristics and interests and lets be real, Hirotaka is hella cute I am shaking. Anyways! The relationships between the mc’s are developing as they get to know each other more and more and I am truly enjoying that journey, especially the little fights between Hanako and...Tarou.If you’re looking for something laid back yet cute and funny (and at times relatable), then I’d really recommend watching this. This is definitely my favourite out of the new anime airing this season.ps: I rated this with a 10 because I mainly rate anime based on how much I enjoy watching it so there's that!",im honestly enjoying anime much look forward next episode every weeklove hard otaku simple funny cute series reference displaying struggle benefit relationship otaku whether friendly relationship something morethe main character characteristic interest let real hirotaka hella cute shaking anyways relationship mc developing get know truly enjoying journey especially little fight hanako andtarouif youre looking something laid back yet cute funny time relatable id really recommend watching definitely favourite new anime airing seasonps rated mainly rate anime based much enjoy watching there,positive,0.1868801652892562,0.5403040141676505
"I'm surprised there aren't more people disappointed by this show. And while I am in no way someone who thinks that a faithful adaptation is required to make a good show (see: maid dragon), I think this anime really misses the mark.Starting with the basics, the animation is distractingly bad. This show definitely probably wouldn't require the large animation budget a lot of other shows need (except possibly some of the in game shots later), they definitely cut it back to the bare minimum: lots of still reaction shots, background art that seems disconnected from the foreground characters, and oh my god the faces....The faces seem like they were outsourced to a country where people's eyes wander around their face more than the plot in a bad fanfic.Jokes aside, the story and characters are where this anime loses any hope of redemption. The manga isn't funny or sweet purely through the ""nerd-culture"" content of its jokes, but because the character interaction and great pacing make you feel connected to it. This is a story about people looking to be accepted and wanting to belong, and reading the manga provides a unique feeling of belonging along with them. In stark contrast, this anime feels amazingly routine: uninspired direction causes the character interactions and jokes to fall flat and overall the immersion is totally lost.I cannot enumerate my disappointment in this show; I was really looking forward to it. There's so much missed opportunity for something amazing, but in the end, this story feels like just one out of a thousand generic anime romcoms. If you're looking for something like this show, Net-juu no Susume's anime walks all over this.",im surprised arent people disappointed show way someone think faithful adaptation required make good show see maid dragon think anime really miss markstarting basic animation distractingly bad show definitely probably wouldnt require large animation budget lot show need except possibly game shot later definitely cut back bare minimum lot still reaction shot background art seems disconnected foreground character oh god facesthe face seem like outsourced country people eye wander around face plot bad fanficjokes aside story character anime loses hope redemption manga isnt funny sweet purely nerdculture content joke character interaction great pacing make feel connected story people looking accepted wanting belong reading manga provides unique feeling belonging along stark contrast anime feel amazingly routine uninspired direction cause character interaction joke fall flat overall immersion totally losti enumerate disappointment show really looking forward there much missed opportunity something amazing end story feel like one thousand generic anime romcoms youre looking something like show netjuu susumes anime walk,positive,0.021889400921659,0.4810291858678955
"Who had enough of looking for a fulfilling romance in anime? Who got tired of the school-setting romance with dense characters that don't acknowledge their feelings until the last minute of the anime and they don't even hug or share a kiss? I don't know about you, but I have had enough!I tried a lot of romance anime in search of one that has the characters confess in the beginning and then the remaining of the series is them developing their relationship. But I was always disappointed. That is until I came across Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii.In the beginning, I tried watching the first...episode just to reconcile my hopeless relationship with romance animes. I went in with low expectations but that first episode threw me off guard!A confession in the first episode! I hope I wasn't dreaming! I replayed those two minutes until I believed my eyes, and my heart felt, for the first time in a very long while, full.I grew accustomed to getting disappointed in things that start off too good, so I went to the second episode reluctantly. It just got better.The anime revolves around two relationships. We get glances at how two 'otaku' couples live their everyday life at work, how they get through their days, how they support each other, and most importantly, we see glances of their love for each other and it's the cutest thing I have witnessed in a while. It has got a light-hearted comedy to complement everything and it works so well with the setting.This is a very wholesome anime. It doesn't have the forced drama, the unnecessary love triangle, the frustrating misunderstandings that could have been solved with talking, the teen angst. It is a pure romance comedy to lighten your mood and make you feel good after a shitty day. It is a win to the romance genre.",enough looking fulfilling romance anime got tired schoolsetting romance dense character dont acknowledge feeling last minute anime dont even hug share kiss dont know enoughi tried lot romance anime search one character confess beginning remaining series developing relationship always disappointed came across wotaku ni koi wa muzukashiiin beginning tried watching firstepisode reconcile hopeless relationship romance anime went low expectation first episode threw guarda confession first episode hope wasnt dreaming replayed two minute believed eye heart felt first time long fulli grew accustomed getting disappointed thing start good went second episode reluctantly got betterthe anime revolves around two relationship get glance two otaku couple live everyday life work get day support importantly see glance love cutest thing witnessed got lighthearted comedy complement everything work well settingthis wholesome anime doesnt forced drama unnecessary love triangle frustrating misunderstanding could solved talking teen angst pure romance comedy lighten mood make feel good shitty day win romance genre,positive,0.06044372294372294,0.4944444444444444
"Are u sick of all those high school setting romance show? Did u just finish ur job feeling tired trying to find some refreshment? Look no further as Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi) has got u covered. This is a very laid back show, if youre already have enough of the action shows this season provides with us, heres one that ill highly recommend for anyone who is up for their time.Wotakoi is a very well done rom-com series set in modern day Japan, covering our fellow otaku MCs, and otaku side characters. As aforementioned, our MCs are otakus, they like anime,...just like we all do. The story starts of with our female MC, Momose getting (almost) late for her new job, whilst being scared that her identity as an otaku will be found out by her new coworker. While being shown around the new environment of the office, she found herself coincidentally bumping into her old friend, Hirotaka, our male MC. At first the characters might turn u off as they seem very dull, but youll soon realize that they are just normal, very normal to a point that its like real life, a slice of life indeed. Its fun to watch as the characters start unveiling their little bits in life, how the progressed through their 'hardships' and stuff, the show is very engaging, and occasionally throwing references here and there, which ultimately leads into a far more enjoyable experience.Artstyle of Wotakoi is not impressive, but still very clean, polished, its smooth for ur eyes, I doubt anyone will complain about how it looks. I mean, as bad as how sometimes A-1 screw themselves over very badly, this here isnt the case. OST wise, the OP and ED is something ill never skip, they are just too good for not listening/watching. The songs are very good, but mostly the animation in the OP, absolutely fantastic. Its one of those very creative OPs youll ever bump into every now and then, like how the characters rotate with the camera angles, those transitions are just seamless, cocaine for ur eyes. Soundtracks in the anime itself thou doesnt have much of an impression left in me, either I was paying enough attention because of how well the anime is, or they were just there to compliment the show, nothing that memorable, but nothing to complain as well. Overall a very good and clean presentation.Now before I conclude, I rate the shows I watch MOSTLY by enjoyment. If a show is enjoyable, ill give it 8 and above, and thats probably why u might see that I have quite a high mean score for the animes Ive rated. As a 10/10 that Ive given, this is one of the shows that I think will undoubtedly be enjoyable for all, a very simple story, very likable characters and catchy OP/ED, all adds up to a great show overall. This is one of the shows that ill anticipate for every week, like how when youre 6 and eagerly waiting for the ice cream truck to come by every weekend. Even if rom-com isnt your taste, by all means give it a try, maybe youll poke into a region youve never experienced before too.",u sick high school setting romance show u finish ur job feeling tired trying find refreshment look wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii wotakoi got u covered laid back show youre already enough action show season provides u here one ill highly recommend anyone timewotakoi well done romcom series set modern day japan covering fellow otaku mc otaku side character aforementioned mc otakus like animejust like story start female mc momose getting almost late new job whilst scared identity otaku found new coworker shown around new environment office found coincidentally bumping old friend hirotaka male mc first character might turn u seem dull youll soon realize normal normal point like real life slice life indeed fun watch character start unveiling little bit life progressed hardship stuff show engaging occasionally throwing reference ultimately lead far enjoyable experienceartstyle wotakoi impressive still clean polished smooth ur eye doubt anyone complain look mean bad sometimes screw badly isnt case ost wise op ed something ill never skip good listeningwatching song good mostly animation op absolutely fantastic one creative ops youll ever bump every like character rotate camera angle transition seamless cocaine ur eye soundtrack anime thou doesnt much impression left either paying enough attention well anime compliment show nothing memorable nothing complain well overall good clean presentationnow conclude rate show watch mostly enjoyment show enjoyable ill give thats probably u might see quite high mean score anime ive rated ive given one show think undoubtedly enjoyable simple story likable character catchy oped add great show overall one show ill anticipate every week like youre eagerly waiting ice cream truck come every weekend even romcom isnt taste mean give try maybe youll poke region youve never experienced,positive,0.10542018827733113,0.5471231017659589
"Looking for a true romance, one with suspense, fluff, and drama? Then I will make this incredibly clear that this anime is not for you! I feel like I have to make this clear because I went into this anime based on description, genre, and rating expecting a romance and it really did not deliver.It has a lot of good qualities however. Anime and game lovers will find themselves identifying with the characters, and you’ll find yourself laughing at the exaggerated, but still relatable content. The art is also really cute, all the characters are distinct and different despite all being categorized as otaku’s....You get a peek into the lives of otaku’s of all different types, cosplay, crossplay, manga, videogames, anime, bl, etc. The main fandoms are all represented at least briefly. In its purest form, this anime is just about balancing otaku life with work life, that’s it.Still don’t believe me this isn’t a romance? Then I will spoil (but not really) the romance involved in this anime. For starters, the couple gets together by the end of episode one and it’s treated more like a joke. There is only one kiss scene the entire anime and all it is, is a peck (and it’s not even at the end of the series that this happens, so yea...no kiss at the end either) and again, it’s treated more like a joke. There’s really no development shown in the relationship, no misunderstands, or ups and downs. It’s more like two coworkers who share similar interests that happen to be a couple.I will confess that my score may be on the lower end than what this anime deserves. It’s actually a pretty good light-hearted, comedy. The art is cute, the characters are distinct and fun, and I admittedly got some laughs out of it, but I didn’t get what I wanted out of it and thus ended up rather disappointed.",looking true romance one suspense fluff drama make incredibly clear anime feel like make clear went anime based description genre rating expecting romance really deliverit lot good quality however anime game lover find identifying character youll find laughing exaggerated still relatable content art also really cute character distinct different despite categorized otakusyou get peek life otakus different type cosplay crossplay manga videogames anime bl etc main fandom represented least briefly purest form anime balancing otaku life work life thats itstill dont believe isnt romance spoil really romance involved anime starter couple get together end episode one treated like joke one kiss scene entire anime peck even end series happens yeano kiss end either treated like joke there really development shown relationship misunderstands ups down like two coworkers share similar interest happen couplei confess score may lower end anime deserves actually pretty good lighthearted comedy art cute character distinct fun admittedly got laugh didnt get wanted thus ended rather disappointed,positive,0.10967078189300408,0.48693415637860077
"Part of becoming an adult is finding hobbies that enrich our life and fill the time after exhausting days at work. Wotaku centers around 4 main characters who are obssessed with hobbies society frowns upon, some of whom have little to no social skills at all. Momose, the main lead, is obssessed with manga, especially Yaoi, something she's had to hide from all her previous boyfriends and friends. The other 3 aren't much different: Hanako is also into yaoi and cosplay, her boyfriend Kabakura obssesses over yuri and gaming, and Nifuji games almost to the expense of all else. Momose and Nifuji are childhood friends,...and he comes to an idea: they won't have to hide they're both otakus if they date.The art and character models are stock standard for modern anime, and the soundtrack is sufficient but nothing special. There's promise in a story of adult couples who pursue their own hobbies, finding their own group that values what they do. Let's ignore Momose and Hanako's love of fetishized yaoi, or Kabukara's hyper-infantilized yuri, which is opening a can of worms. The major flaw is the characters are engaging as soggy noodles in a watered down broth. The female leads have their boy's love extend into their real life partners, getting excited by any close interactions between the two. They debate in a single scene which one is the top and which is the bottom. The character dynamics revolve around their eccentric hobbies, but we never get more than a superficial glance at those hobbies.But the biggest flaw is the characters seem to not care for each other. Nifuji and Momose's relationship never extends past childhood friends, even after they start dating. She's not particularly attracted to him, and he makes it clear he'd be into a girl with larger breasts. Their relationship and interactions barely progress or regress. It feels like one of convenience and never develops from that. We never really dive into their actual interests, besides passing references and some stock standard online gameplay.Hanako and Kabukara constantly fight when others are around, even if their interactions are much more lukewarm when they're alone together. Hanako's hobbies are probably the most engaging: she's a well-known cosplayer, and diving into the process she designs and creates the costumes could be an excellent story. At least they seem to care for each other, and spend some enjoyable moments together.The entire character dynamic is ""are the straights ok"" the anime. With a stronger cast, a deeper dive into their interests, or a stronger plot, Wotaku could be engaging with an adult cast so desperately needed in romance anime. Instead, we get something that anyone but a hardcore otaku could really enjoy. Wotaku pales in comparison to other stories revolving around otaku like ""Princess Jellyfish"". The dive into online gaming is superficial unlike ""Recovery of an MMO Junkie"". The obsession with yaoi never extends to what we see in ""Kiss Him, Not Me"". It's not particularly bad but it's uninspired at best.",part becoming adult finding hobby enrich life fill time exhausting day work wotaku center around main character obssessed hobby society frown upon little social skill momose main lead obssessed manga especially yaoi something shes hide previous boyfriend friend arent much different hanako also yaoi cosplay boyfriend kabakura obssesses yuri gaming nifuji game almost expense else momose nifuji childhood friendsand come idea wont hide theyre otakus datethe art character model stock standard modern anime soundtrack sufficient nothing special there promise story adult couple pursue hobby finding group value let ignore momose hanakos love fetishized yaoi kabukaras hyperinfantilized yuri opening worm major flaw character engaging soggy noodle watered broth female lead boy love extend real life partner getting excited close interaction two debate single scene one top bottom character dynamic revolve around eccentric hobby never get superficial glance hobbiesbut biggest flaw character seem care nifuji momos relationship never extends past childhood friend even start dating shes particularly attracted make clear hed girl larger breast relationship interaction barely progress regress feel like one convenience never develops never really dive actual interest besides passing reference stock standard online gameplayhanako kabukara constantly fight others around even interaction much lukewarm theyre alone together hanakos hobby probably engaging shes wellknown cosplayer diving process design creates costume could excellent story least seem care spend enjoyable moment togetherthe entire character dynamic straight ok anime stronger cast deeper dive interest stronger plot wotaku could engaging adult cast desperately needed romance anime instead get something anyone hardcore otaku could really enjoy wotaku pale comparison story revolving around otaku like princess jellyfish dive online gaming superficial unlike recovery mmo junkie obsession yaoi never extends see kiss particularly bad uninspired best,positive,0.09702605570530098,0.42938454627133865
"What makes a good romcom anime?CharactersComedyNarrativeRelationships...DramaRomanceTheses are the things that usually make a romcom anime better not always good though. In the Spring 18 anime season there were two romcom that were strangely competing with each other. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku. Both of these show uses all of these elements that I just listed to make theses respective shows better but yet only one of them was good though.3D Kanojo Real Girl is a badly written romcom where only it had characters would talk over with each other without letting the other person finish but at various times the show hardly feels like a romcom as the show feels like more like a shitty slice of life anime set in high school. Not to mention the portrayal of Otaku culture as well the characterization and relationships were handled very poorly to a point where point where you just want to headbang a table.Thankfully its competitor WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku did not suffer from any of the problems that caused 3D Kanojo Real Girl to become such a horrendous romcom anime and as a result WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku became the best romcom of 2018. Not the best anime of 2018 but still a pretty great one.So what made this romcom so great you may ask?You gonna to find out soon enough.Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku and with that said and done let's get started.Story.The story follows a female officer worker Narumi who secretly hides her Fujoshi lifestyle from her co-workers. One day at work she is reunited with her gaming geek childhood Hirotaka after discovering that they work at the same company. After some drinking sessions outside of work they start to date each other but will it end up being a perfect relationship for theses two or will they fall apart.I really liked the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.For starters the show does a great at establishing its characters right from the first episode.  Unlike 3D Kanojo Real Girl where that show establishes the two main characters in a contrived and silly way Wotakoi decides to establish its main cast in a more mature where in the very first scene of the show where Narumi begins chatting kindly to Hirotaka. Unlike 3D Kanojo where by now both leads would talk over each other and random crap we actually to hear Narumi inner thoughts were we find out this is all a front to keep her secret from being exposed. Hirotaka end ups only partially revealing her secret but it quickly hard cuts to them drinking together. Not only does the show do a great job at presenting its actions that they were both otaku's but it manages to respect the tone of the office setting. The thing that sold me in this show is how the how portrays its romance because you see in real life there’s always a time and place where you can date as the two love birds in the show actually don’t date with each other until a day of work is over. Meaning when Hirotaka and Naruni are not working they are dating.Like with any good romcom the show uses it comedy and romance elements right allowing us to really relate to every comedic and romance conversation that's goes along.The show also a great job at portraying the Otaku culture where it showcases the highs and lows being an Otaku as an adult age. Not to mention the show goes a great job with it's references to video games and anime like Monster Hunter, Mario Kart,  JoJo etcThe one thing that this show over most romcom that are coming out in recently is how the show doesn't take place at high school. Don't get me wrong I like my fair share of anime that were set in high school but in recent memory the high school setting itself was getting too abused to a point where some shows that would have been better if the shows were not in high school.  I know this doesn’t really make a romcom show but for this case it does because we get to see a romance that is in a more mature setting that it has its own rules to follow.Overall the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great.9/10Characters.The characters in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku pretty good for the most part.Our female romcom lead Narumi is a pretty good character. Despite trying to hide her Otaku interests from her workmates she’s actually a nice and passion girl who loves Otaku hobbies. However I have one sight problem with her and that she can a hypocritical at times where there was a piece of dialogue where Hirotaka asks Narumi why she hasn't tried dating someone who understands Otaku, she replies that only another Otaku would understand and Otaku are gross, so she won't do it. Am sorry but why would you deny a man who also an Otaku. If anything I thought date him because you both love the Otaku culture. Thankfully she becomes a better character later where she accepts dating with Hirotaka a man who is an Otaku but at there were times she can be bit cringe-worthy. Minus her slight cringly attitude at times I liked Narumi for the most part.Hirotaka is probably the best character in the series. Unlike Narumi he doesn’t even bother hiding that being a Otaku as he is seen doing Otaku things in the open and he’s not a shamed of it.The character chemistry for Narumi and Hirotaka is nothing but brilliant as they talk they time to understand each by doing all of these Otaku act’s outside of work life.Hanako and Tarou are two characters that I liked. Unlike Hirotaka and Narumi they relationship is a rocky one as they constantly like having a go with each other like enemies most of the time. While they are not as memorable as the main two couple I thought they were still enjoyable characters.Overall the characters were pretty good and enjoyable.8/10Visuals.For a romcom anime this shows looks great. A1 Pictures did a awesome at capturing the setting of the series with it's nice use of business colour pallets that blends in well the shows great character and appealing designs. This is by far the best looking anime I have seen from A1 Pictures and it's not even a shounen series while most of those shows would have decent to average visuals at best. Honestly if A1 Pictures had more anime in this style for they action series then those shows would have been least Bones/J.C Staff tier instead of looking at they just came out from McDonalds unfinished filled with art failures.The animation is pretty nice and smooth for what it is so that’s that.8/10Sound.The soundtrack in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great overall as it does a great at capturing the tone and setting of the series.Both the opening and ending themes of the show are very good and memorable.The voice acting is top notch overall. All the Seyiuss did a great job with the roles that were given.9/10Final Thoughts.Overall this show was just great romcom to start to finish.The story was great, the romance was excellent, and comedy was great and well executed. The characters are great where they all likeable in they own ways. The visuals were surprisingly great and appealing and the soundtrack was beautiful.Despite being only 11 episodes this show was still able to be a better and well thought out romcom anime then the likes of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san and 3D Kanojo Real Girl. It may not be my favourite romcom series ever but I was still one hell of a good one.If you’re looking for a great romcom anime that explores the Otaku culture in a realistic way that I recommend

"Wotakoi is a romance between young adults. Gamer guy who wears glasses and yaoi fangirl who acts like a tomboy. Apparently they aren't very confident about their own hobbies so naturally they go and announce their otaku lifestyle in a manner similar to ""yes, I am a vegan"" meme. Pretty cool.There are few things I quite like. Wotakoi has very direct dialogue, People say what they think and don't hide inside their shells. These characters are honest and don't spend 15 episodes pondering over how to convey. The comedy -especially after the first 2 episodes- is genius. The series is full of gamer memes...that feel very accurate to 90's kids (which our main characters also are). Episode 3 is a perfect example of rom-com done right.The main characters don't feel very special nor memorable. They are just normal, realistic folks who are doing the slice of life thingy. Arguably very smart choice when considering the nature of this series. Still, I found myself getting attached to them in just 2 episodes, and am already looking forward to seeing where their relationship will head. The actual romance between them is super cute and innocent. The overall execution makes Wotakoi seem like a feel-good series.At first, the side characters seem pretty dull, and come off quite comedic, but soon turns out they are pretty much the same as our main pair, just not in the lead role in this series. This is something to which I typically pay a lot attention, but this time our side characters are actually real characters and not filler people. I can appreciate that.The art and animation are rather typical. Nothing note-worthy in terms of good or bad. It has chosen the safe route, which is fine. The seiyuus consist of some big names, but none which voice I have yet grown tired of hearing, so I have no problems with that. When it comes to the OST, I have been too busy giggling at the cute romance scenes so I completely did not pay attention to any of the songs or if there even were any present. I only recall the video game BGM from episode 1. The series made a good job on making me forget that I was watching an anime. This is pretty much the perfect prove -for myself at least- that it is a decent show.",wotakoi romance young adult gamer guy wear glass yaoi fangirl act like tomboy apparently arent confident hobby naturally go announce otaku lifestyle manner similar yes vegan meme pretty coolthere thing quite like wotakoi direct dialogue people say think dont hide inside shell character honest dont spend episode pondering convey comedy especially first episode genius series full gamer memesthat feel accurate kid main character also episode perfect example romcom done rightthe main character dont feel special memorable normal realistic folk slice life thingy arguably smart choice considering nature series still found getting attached episode already looking forward seeing relationship head actual romance super cute innocent overall execution make wotakoi seem like feelgood seriesat first side character seem pretty dull come quite comedic soon turn pretty much main pair lead role series something typically pay lot attention time side character actually real character filler people appreciate thatthe art animation rather typical nothing noteworthy term good bad chosen safe route fine seiyuus consist big name none voice yet grown tired hearing problem come ost busy giggling cute romance scene completely pay attention song even present recall video game bgm episode series made good job making forget watching anime pretty much perfect prove least decent show,positive,0.2087706511175898,0.5604956268221575
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (or simply Wotakoi), have two genres. Comedy and romance. That's it. Romcoms nowadays in the anime community has been popular in the late 2010's sparking a big genre called ''School''.Yet Im not talking about the ''School'' genre here. Im talking about how Wotakoi done an excellent job on progressing and making unique attempts on a Romantic-comedy segment that is surprisingly not taking place in a high school. Instead it follows the workplace of four unique characters. Unique as in every single one of this four have unique attributes that you can say ''How in the world does this four have...a partner with their attitudes?''.The story revolves mainly on the four characters of the show. Inspite of that, each episode offers uniqueness and heart-warming scenes that can make either audience feel comfortable or laugh at. It mainly focus on the lives of Nifuji Hirotaka (the quiet, not that sociable gamer), Momose Narumi (the cute, sparkling otaku and yaoi fan), Kabakura Tarou (the guy you always meet in the bar who looks like a thug but has a genuine heart) and Koyanagi Hanako (the cosplaying-loving woman and the only one who can stand-up against Kabakura.) Each episodes offers rare shots from a Rom-com like any other. Instead of doing classwork, they do office work. They are not students. They are adults. The fact that Wotakoi stands out this season is that its not like your typical high school drama like Tada-kun this season. It shows the picture of office workers and adulthood. The one thing that made this anime different to our ''in-real-life'' adulthood is that, Wotakoi still offers the taste of an otaku. Whether your a figurine collector, gamer, yaoi fan, manga fan or an anime fan, you can relate to either one or two or even every single character from these four and will make you laugh out loud. Its not only the environment is unique. The love story of this four as well. The fact that each character, have different taste, interest and attitude made them understand each other is truly inspiring. That is what you call friendship. Real friendship and that exist on the adulthood. I'm not against to the current status of Rom-coms on anime being on a high school environment. I mean some are good. Some are average. Although one thing is certain.. is that Wotakoi can upgrade the romantic-comedy segment into a whole new level.Every anime comes down into judging it by art, and Wotakoi, in all honesty, made it average on my opinion. Average although watchable. You don't need a very good animation for a romantic-comedy and all. This is not action. Although I would love to note that the animation used in the gaming episode and the opening is excellent.Speaking of the opening, this is one of those openings I added to my anime playlists because its just too good. Along with the animation and the dance (hands) choreography on the chorus of the opening, it is a great way to start off the episode. The ending as well. With its art picturing the characters like going home from a busy day of work to sleeping, with a cheerful singing, its just fit to the theme of Wotakoi.Overall, this anime when I first saw it on the PV or trailer, I was expecting it to be a good take for romance and comedy genre and I was not disappointed going through the 11 episodes. Wotakoi is good uptake of the genre and I rated it this high because of its story, mixing it with well-developed characters, fine animation, heart-warming openings and endings, and a good comedic material.",wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii simply wotakoi two genre comedy romance thats romcoms nowadays anime community popular late sparking big genre called schoolyet im talking school genre im talking wotakoi done excellent job progressing making unique attempt romanticcomedy segment surprisingly taking place high school instead follows workplace four unique character unique every single one four unique attribute say world four havea partner attitudesthe story revolves mainly four character show inspite episode offer uniqueness heartwarming scene make either audience feel comfortable laugh mainly focus life nifuji hirotaka quiet sociable gamer momose narumi cute sparkling otaku yaoi fan kabakura tarou guy always meet bar look like thug genuine heart koyanagi hanako cosplayingloving woman one standup kabakura episode offer rare shot romcom like instead classwork office work student adult fact wotakoi stand season like typical high school drama like tadakun season show picture office worker adulthood one thing made anime different inreallife adulthood wotakoi still offer taste otaku whether figurine collector gamer yaoi fan manga fan anime fan relate either one two even every single character four make laugh loud environment unique love story four well fact character different taste interest attitude made understand truly inspiring call friendship real friendship exist adulthood im current status romcoms anime high school environment mean good average although one thing certain wotakoi upgrade romanticcomedy segment whole new levelevery anime come judging art wotakoi honesty made average opinion average although watchable dont need good animation romanticcomedy action although would love note animation used gaming episode opening excellentspeaking opening one opening added anime playlist good along animation dance hand choreography chorus opening great way start episode ending well art picturing character like going home busy day work sleeping cheerful singing fit theme wotakoioverall anime first saw pv trailer expecting good take romance comedy genre disappointed going episode wotakoi good uptake genre rated high story mixing welldeveloped character fine animation heartwarming opening ending good comedic material,positive,0.25164255335307956,0.5647810814916079

"Wotaku ni koi muzukashii (or Wotakoi for short) is a really nice and cute anime.Now I have seen some comments saying that this anime has no plot and is just the daily lives of some otaku people. Have you not heard of Slice of Life? This is very much a slice of life, it has little to no plot but is just stuff that happens nearly on the daily. It is nice.The comedy also nicely hits, usually, if an anime is boring I find myself skipping a lot, but this anime I do not skip times so that is good.The story is about these...4 people, and they are otakus (nerds). One of them like Yaoi, one is a cosplayer, one loves video games, one loves collecting idols, etc. There are 2 couples in those people, and they are very open about their nerdiness in front of each other. It is very wholesome.This anime appeases the otaku fandom and romanticizes them in my opinion. Sure nothing wrong with loving a hobby, but being that engrossed in something to the point where it affects your relationship is wild and is romanticized here.The music is nice.OP is really really good, music is nice and all but OP animation is amazing.Animation quality is also really good. I liked it.Overall really nice show!8/10 still not really life-changing as I would give 9 or 10/10's.

"I hate long reviews myself, so I'm gonna make it short. Full disclaimer, I dropped it after watching 6 episodes.MC - Main CharacterFMC - Female Main CharacterThis is not a romance anime even though it has the romance tag. The pathetic amount of romance it has is pretty one-sided and goes nowhere.Someone needs to tell these mangakas that there needs to be progress and not at a turtle speed. I mean, the premise was good, but I was expecting the main couple to start developing feelings for one another over time but that never happened.By the 6 episode, it was clear to me that the...MC liked the FMC but there was no sign of romantic interest from the FMC side. Hell, she treated other male characters better than she did the MC, and on top of that, it was pretty clear that the MC wasn't even her type, meaning she was not attracted to him, which is fine by me but ONLY if it slowly starts to change. Sadly, as I said, it did not.Overall: I was pretty disappointed because I did not get what I wanted from the show. One-sided love is not fun to watch especially if it does not develop into something more. A rom-com that has VERY little romance.Recommendation: Skip it. There are far better rom-coms out there such as Kamisama Hajimemashita.",hate long review im gon na make short full disclaimer dropped watching episodesmc main characterfmc female main characterthis romance anime even though romance tag pathetic amount romance pretty onesided go nowheresomeone need tell mangakas need progress turtle speed mean premise good expecting main couple start developing feeling one another time never happenedby episode clear themc liked fmc sign romantic interest fmc side hell treated male character better mc top pretty clear mc wasnt even type meaning attracted fine slowly start change sadly said notoverall pretty disappointed get wanted show onesided love fun watch especially develop something romcom little romancerecommendation skip far better romcoms kamisama hajimemashita,positive,0.06505376344086021,0.587768817204301
"I'm wondering what's happening with slice of life shows lately.It's as if anime producers had a secret consensus, and on it they decided they'll sneak in non-existent plot into shows, and focus on making money with as little effort as possible. News flash: just because a show has slice of life genre in it, it doesn't allow it to be boring to the point of being a comatose-inducing drug.I can give you endless examples of other shows being super interesting regardless of main theme simply tracking a character or characters' lives or other barely existing plot examples. Wotakoi went off rails with plot less than...mid-way through, and decided to show filler episodes instead.Now, I haven't read the manga and perhaps it's different in it, but it doesn't excuse the poor, or rather, a complete lack of pacing and direction, resulting in my lack of engagement.Slightly annoying factor is that the shows such as this one somehow get a pass by an average person's critique and are now considered quality shows, when they are not. I get that by making the setting as uncomplicated as possible, you know, just a regular present day, no supernatural circumstances, or no deep psychological battle mysteries like known to all Death Note, no melodrama or different harem routes, none of that shit, it's guaranteed to avoid pretty much any illogical executions, events, inconsistencies or plot holes, like many action series suffer from for example, but there's no excuse for having a lack of guidance altogether and just call it quits.Atmosphere is lovely, characters are sympathetic, it's bundled in nice, shiny wrappings, the overall presentation is great, yet it ultimately fails to deliver any conclusion, it's too tedious and lacks life. I'm sorry but this will not go unnoticed by some people, myself included.I don't hate this show by a long shot, but I don't know how and/or why do these types of shows always leave a bad taste in my mouth.",im wondering whats happening slice life show latelyits anime producer secret consensus decided theyll sneak nonexistent plot show focus making money little effort possible news flash show slice life genre doesnt allow boring point comatoseinducing drugi give endless example show super interesting regardless main theme simply tracking character character life barely existing plot example wotakoi went rail plot less thanmidway decided show filler episode insteadnow havent read manga perhaps different doesnt excuse poor rather complete lack pacing direction resulting lack engagementslightly annoying factor show one somehow get pas average person critique considered quality show get making setting uncomplicated possible know regular present day supernatural circumstance deep psychological battle mystery like known death note melodrama different harem route none shit guaranteed avoid pretty much illogical execution event inconsistency plot hole like many action series suffer example there excuse lack guidance altogether call quitsatmosphere lovely character sympathetic bundled nice shiny wrapping overall presentation great yet ultimately fails deliver conclusion tedious lack life im sorry go unnoticed people includedi dont hate show long shot dont know andor type show always leave bad taste mouth,negative,-0.05377906976744186,0.5321875798619984
"TL;DR It's a 7/10 show that is not meant for everyone. If romcoms are not your genre or want a romance that heavily focuses on development like Tsuki ga Kirei, then I wouldn't recommend it. The humor is good. The Opening is probably the best this season. However, I don't think the 3 episode rule applies here, if you don't like Romantic-Comedies.Wotakoi is a romantic-comedy that steps into the light of adulthood, and basks in the glory of being an Otaku? I'm just kidding. Being an otaku in society is still seen as a overall negative from all the weird things like Hentai and Cosplay...making people seem deranged for dressing as weird fantasy characters...BUT THAT'S GETTING OFF TOPIC. Anyways, Wotakoi is a light-hearted anime that really brings out what makes the romcom scene enjoyable. The character dynamics between all three of the couples: Narumi x Hirotaka ; Kabakura x Koyanagi ; Naoya x Kou, add a level of chemistry and flavor that never steps into disturbing or overbearing with its amount of fluff.Those who are expecting a fully-developed story with lots of romantic progression or character development are going to be sadly disappointed though. Neither of those elements get pushed forward. But, that isn't mean they aren't nurtured. Throughout the entire 11 episodes, the emotions and affection that we see nurtured throughout the entire series, while small, are noticeably different from episode 1 to the ending.Is this a show that everyone should watch? No. I don't think everyone is going to enjoy Wotakoi. It's an anime that feels like it was produced and developed for people like myself who grew up with Romantic-Comedies, and understand that speed is an aspect that rarely happens within these shows.",tldr show meant everyone romcoms genre want romance heavily focus development like tsuki ga kirei wouldnt recommend humor good opening probably best season however dont think episode rule applies dont like romanticcomedieswotakoi romanticcomedy step light adulthood basks glory otaku im kidding otaku society still seen overall negative weird thing like hentai cosplaymaking people seem deranged dressing weird fantasy charactersbut thats getting topic anyways wotakoi lighthearted anime really brings make romcom scene enjoyable character dynamic three couple narumi x hirotaka kabakura x koyanagi naoya x kou add level chemistry flavor never step disturbing overbearing amount fluffthose expecting fullydeveloped story lot romantic progression character development going sadly disappointed though neither element get pushed forward isnt mean arent nurtured throughout entire episode emotion affection see nurtured throughout entire series small noticeably different episode endingis show everyone watch dont think everyone going enjoy wotakoi anime feel like produced developed people like grew romanticcomedies understand speed aspect rarely happens within show,positive,0.013068181818181812,0.5524621212121212
"Ok, so I tried so hard to like this show, I did. I fell in love with megane, (the show is so dreadful I only remember two people's names and they are side characters) at first but then he became so dull as a person, and not because of the cold-monotone personality they were trying to go for. He just was.Pink Hair chick, Momose (I had to open the info tab to get their names), is annoying, loud, and on more than one occasion admits she isn't attracted to her boyfriend. Now they go over this in the show where it could be a relationship...of convenience, (yes, yes it is), but it doesn't get resolved. These two have known each other since childhood, yet this moron doesn't know enough about him to be considered an acquaintance. I had to watch this more than once in case I missed things, sadly, I didn't.Now Gingertoki (Kabakura) and Green Haired chick (Hanako) are like the worst example of a couple. Now, everyone has arguments here and there, especially when both people are stubborn, but f***ing dammit. Him calling her a hag is not cute. Her forcing him to do things isn't cute. They get into a fight and it doesn't even get resolved and it pisses me off. It's unhealthy this type of arguing. They only gave them a couple of good eps and even then it didn't last. Like before it became 100% established that they were dating they were better with each other, then it's made clear and they're at each other's throats just for breathing weird. There is so much they have to work on for a couple that's been together for a decade.It was hard for me to believe that Hirotaka ever had a thing for this dumb chick since childhood. Like it all seemed forced.For all those people that loved it for not being the high school show where it takes ages for the couple to admit their feelings, you have been tricked with this show. These two dated because ""why not we're both otakus"" (worst reason), and throughout the show they couldn't admit their feelings. He didn't tell her how long he liked her for, she was still uncertain of the whole relationship the whole damn time, she was still not attracted to him until he removed his glasses and other chicks wanted him. Saying she hadn't seen him like that. Honestly, I can barely see them as friends. It's not that they're going slow, there is no fucking chemistry, hell there was more chemistry with Momose  (I did it, I remembered a name without having to look back) and Naoya. This whole show was Momose wondering if she loved Megane. They are literally acting like those kids that think they should date because they have things in common, but they really shouldn't because they just don't mesh well. So it is another high school show where the lead couple won't admit their feelings or act on them. It's just been dressed up differently.Now the one thing that wasn't resolved and I fear it will be for  season 2 that this show doesn't deserve, is the relationship with Naoya and Kou. Now those two were believable as a potential couple. It's like the writers spent more time making those two likable. Those seriously are the only ones I'm rooting for and even like. If there is a season 2, I won't watch it,  but at least resolve something.I give Garbagetaku a 2/10 only bc I love Naoya and Kou.",ok tried hard like show fell love megane show dreadful remember two people name side character first became dull person coldmonotone personality trying go waspink hair chick momose open info tab get name annoying loud one occasion admits isnt attracted boyfriend go show could relationshipof convenience yes yes doesnt get resolved two known since childhood yet moron doesnt know enough considered acquaintance watch case missed thing sadly didntnow gingertoki kabakura green haired chick hanako like worst example couple everyone argument especially people stubborn fing dammit calling hag cute forcing thing isnt cute get fight doesnt even get resolved piss unhealthy type arguing gave couple good eps even didnt last like became established dating better made clear theyre others throat breathing weird much work couple thats together decadeit hard believe hirotaka ever thing dumb chick since childhood like seemed forcedfor people loved high school show take age couple admit feeling tricked show two dated otakus worst reason throughout show couldnt admit feeling didnt tell long liked still uncertain whole relationship whole damn time still attracted removed glass chick wanted saying hadnt seen like honestly barely see friend theyre going slow fucking chemistry hell chemistry momose remembered name without look back naoya whole show momose wondering loved megane literally acting like kid think date thing common really shouldnt dont mesh well another high school show lead couple wont admit feeling act dressed differentlynow one thing wasnt resolved fear season show doesnt deserve relationship naoya kou two believable potential couple like writer spent time making two likable seriously one im rooting even like season wont watch least resolve somethingi give garbagetaku bc love naoya kou,negative,-0.01826666666666667,0.5762666666666666
"Growing up from a kid to adulthood, I’m sure all of us has our own favorite hobbies, interests, or dirty little secret. Not many people like to admit it but it’s part of our society and how we live in. For a show about the otaku culture and exploring the lifestyle of the nerd norm, Wotake ni Koi wa Muzukashii really set the bar high. Welcome to a world where office romance, otakuism, and gaming culture become an experience you won’t forget.The English translation title is “It’s Difficult to Love an Otaku” and “Love is Hard of Otaku”. Literally, those words mushed up together already...feels like the show is a big joke or satire. While the show seems like it’s taking a risk at mixing a variety of questionable gimmicks together, I can say safely that there’s no need to worry. As a fan of the manga, I was thrilled to learn that Noitamina was chosen to air this show. It seems fitting for such an anime based on their history of lineups. What’s more is that this show also portrays a more realistic slice of life story that you don’t see too often these days. To me, this was a God-sent gift for Spring 2018.I’m not going to lie. Watching this anime reminds me of being a kid despite the show being targeted at an older audience. The goofy style of the storytelling along with the colorful character cast brings in a very playful atmosphere. Even as the show takes place in an office life environment, it’s hard to ignore the character chemistry between the main cast. From the start, we got two childhood friends named Narumi Momose and Hirotaka Nifuji. The two have known each other for awhile but are almost like complete polar opposites. Narumi is a bubbly outgoing girl with an interest in fujoshi and otome games. On the other hand, Nifuji is an otaku with an avid interest in video games and doesn’t actually seem to care what other thinks of him. Despite their different personalities, it’s undeniable that the two has chemistry both during and off work. The other two lovebirds in the show consists of Hanako Koanagi and Tarou Kabakura. They are dating as a couple and while the two constantly bickers at every chance they get, the two genuinely seems to love each other. Now, you’re probably thinking…is this going to be a show filled with drama and misunderstandings? Absolutely not. While the show contains office romance, it’s hardly a story that focuses on that exclusively. Instead, this anime stands out as a way of exploring the everyday adventures of these characters.One of the primary factors that makes this show appealing is the small character cast. It capitalizes on giving every character a chance to shine without leaving another in the dust. The couple pair of Narumi and Nifuji is infectiously entertaining to watch. Their character chemistry is shown through their interests that somehow intersects with their daily lives. At the office, the two maintains a professional relationship although they still act casually towards each other. The show explores their relationship development as they understand each other more in their adult lives. This even includes going on dates to the movies or amusement park. While the show adapts their relationship more as a ship tease, I think it’s safe that fans accepts them as a couple. Hanako and Tarou are dating already so the show doesn’t hide the fact that they care for each other. It’s mostly lighthearted romance that relies more on realism to do the storytelling. Office romance isn’t easy to adapt but this anime does that without ever being distracting. Characters act the way humans do while drawing connection to their otaku interests. Each of the main characters has their own interest. (otome games, gamer, cosplaying, bishoujo) As a central theme of the show, it establishes their interest through dialogues, interactions, and references. The show often throws in jokes with characters’ small talk and arguing to sell its comedy. It’s damn entertaining as every character gets their moment of fame. It masterfully matches the pacing of the dialogues that feels very real. The impression those moments bring is an accurate depiction of how co-workers behave. Whenever this nerdy group goes out for a drink, they act like casual adults enjoying life. It brings in the sensation of a rom-com between working adults that leaves me satisfied. Oh and before I forget to mention, give the manga a try too. The anime actually expands on some background content but the manga also feels like its own little world.To be honest, A-1 Pictures is the last studio I would imagine adapting this show. However, the production quality itself is vibrant with colorful character designs. The characters looks distinct between one another with their different hair colors and facial expressions. Character reactions also sell a good deal of the comedy especially whenever Narumi reacts in exaggerated manners. As an anime that focuses on otaku, do expect video game references to be made such as the Nintendo Switch and Monster Hunter. There’s even one episode where the characters are adapted into an RPG setting with very gimmicky video game themes.No fan service? No problem. You have the character dialogues doing the talking and most of it delivers humor in the most harmless ways. Yet at the same time, it’s able to create quality entertainment thanks to the talents of the voice cast. Narumi and Hanako in particular are able to bring out the best out of characters through that with their human personalities. The theme songs are also quite creative with their choreography. Namely, the OP song “Fiction” by Sumika is adorably cute with the body language. Every character in the theme songs stands out with their coordinated movements.With 11 episodes, it felt just enough for this anime to do what it’s intended and that’s to sell its ideas to the audience. It succeeds that thanks to its creative circle of characters and their interests. Otakuism is not something that’s accepted easily as a positive culture norm. In fact, it’s often looked down upon in our society. However, this show presented that in a positive way. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the show is recommendable to just about anyone.

"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi for short) is a romance comedy which characters are Otakus (Anime or Game Otakus). It is set in an office setting, featuring 4 main characters (2 couples) that are dating each other. Here in there, you would see direct references to manga, anime, games, and the likes. However, this anime fails to deliver well in both comedy and romance. I think it is important for you to treat this more as a slice of life show featuring otaku couples, as to not give any unmet expectations.The romance in this anime is more of just a setting as it is...hardly explored. It will only occasionally throw in some romantic moments. Meanwhile, the jokes in this anime are rarely funny. I feel like the biggest problem to the comedy is the awful timing. It is really slow at delivering punchlines, making it unfunny at most times. To make it worse, there are sometimes short explanations by the game-sounding-narrator, which further slows down the pace.The characters here are not really outstanding. There's no traits or moments that I feel really stand out from them. Also, even though the couples' relationships might change a little, the characters themselves hardly changes.The background music is one problem I have with this anime. Maybe it's just not my taste, but although there are some good tracks, there are a lot of weird tracks that are just slapped unto an unfitting scene (honestly, I don't think those tracks could fit anywhere).Overall, I think this anime fails to deliver a good romcom. There is only a little romance development and jokes fall flat. This is an anime for watching the daily lives of otaku couples. And that's it, since the only thing this anime got going for it is its relatability for people familiar with the otaku culture.",wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii wotakoi short romance comedy character otakus anime game otakus set office setting featuring main character couple dating would see direct reference manga anime game like however anime fails deliver well comedy romance think important treat slice life show featuring otaku couple give unmet expectationsthe romance anime setting ishardly explored occasionally throw romantic moment meanwhile joke anime rarely funny feel like biggest problem comedy awful timing really slow delivering punchlines making unfunny time make worse sometimes short explanation gamesoundingnarrator slows pacethe character really outstanding there trait moment feel really stand also even though couple relationship might change little character hardly changesthe background music one problem anime maybe taste although good track lot weird track slapped unto unfitting scene honestly dont think track could fit anywhereoverall think anime fails deliver good romcom little romance development joke fall flat anime watching daily life otaku couple thats since thing anime got going relatability people familiar otaku culture,negative,-0.010714285714285735,0.5035714285714286
"I picked up Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii along with 3D Kanojo together back when the show first aired and expected both to be about the same, I gave the former an 8 and the latter a 7 originally if my memory doesn't fail me, and from then on even though both featured otaku (now it's obvious that 3D Kanojo only has one while Wotakoi has it's entire casts as the same but I picked it up together for the same reason) it became clear as day which was fresh garbage and which was the anime that made me dance. Looking at the rating I...think you know what show turned out to be the one that made me dance, yes. This is my review of Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii, ikuze!!!Let's start with some backstory. My last seasonal romance watch was in Summer of 2017, almost exactly three seasons ago, which is shocking because if you know me, I love romance and always strive to watch it in some way or the other but in terms of seasonals I felt tired and stopped focusing on the genre. To reasons obvious to romance fans I felt Spring would be the best season for a romance fan to return to the seasonal genre and found a lot of romance anime to watch, but none, absolutely none made me fall over them as much as I fell over Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii. Not because it's cute, but because it's unique, it's fun, and of course, it's got everything else going for it.I mean, look at it's competition this season (or even the last), what romance anime did we have? Tada-kun started strong but suffered with it's cliche problem shortly after, FranXX continues to be complete garbage in the romance category (and dare I say it every other category), the anime I formerly mentioned, 3D Kanojo almost immediately disappointed me with it's second episode, Grancrest had the same FranXX situation, while Beatless could be considered one slot better than the two mentioned. Leaving us with two romance anime this season that continued to be adored by me, Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii and Akkun To Kanojo. The latter was and still is an enjoyable show but being a short, it can't compare to Wotakoi in the same breath. Why? Read on!First off, it's a fantastic slice of life anime. Wotakoi is how you make a Slice of Life Romance work and I can't find any other examples that bettered it till Winter 2017 (when I first started seasonals) and overall I'm sure it'll rank up in my top 5. Yet again you ask why? Because it knows how to captivate it's watchers with warmth. This brings us to the question, why do we watch romance anime? Many would say that it's because it brings them warmth, and surprise, surprise, Wotakoi gives you that. A cute, warm and fuzzy slice of life anime you can cosy up to whether you're single or with your partner. Even though it's centered on Otakus, it's biggest feature is that there's something for everyone.Everyone will find something in the anime worth relating to and laughing at, and I'm just talking about the normies here, if you're a mild anime watcher or a hardcore one, both parties will find lots and lots to laugh at and references to gloss over with this anime. Be it a Dragon Quest reference, a Final Fantasy reference, a Saekano reference, etc etc. There's lots to list and I don't have enough time to list them all for we must move on to the next best part. The soundtrack. I don't think I need to tell you how popular the Opening is especially with it's dance and there's been countless videos on YouTube (some of which were taken down because Sony Music) showing viewers how the dance is done or how they reacted to this marvelous choreography. And that's not to mention the ED as well. Fantastic, cosy and just a joy to watch, it's an excellent example of a testament to the anime.And we've barely scratched the surface. What else makes the anime so fun? The biggest reason why? THE CHARACTERS! I haven't seen such vibrant AND relatable characters in an anime in a very long time and this was just fabulous. I mean, it makes me wanna write on every character. First off, we didn't get one pairup, we got TWO. Then the interactions, motivations, situations, all made for a really cute yet not over the top anime. It didn't overstep its bounds yet created an environment that only Wotakoi could create and excel in. This isn't a Utopia, this is real life, and the real life says Wotakoi is excellent. Speaking of real life, the wonderful staff who worked on this anime. Having renowned VAs like Sawashiro Miyuki and the legendary Sugita Tomokazu himself, this anime wasn't at all short of talent, and the others too did brilliantly. I never for once felt like the voice actors did a bad job, or that the directing or scripting was bad in any way.I might be sounding like I'm fanboying like crazy but let's just say Wotakoi IS that kind of show. It makes you warm and you're left beaming with happiness. Definitely something I'd call a feel-good show. Oh and, another reason why the anime is so amazing? It's got adults. Not high school kids as the main characters and that gives a LOT of room for different scenarios and even though our lovely cast might seem childish, in the first place, being an otaku is a throwback to childhood anyway. And second, we don't have any blushing game of random meetups and random kisses and random blushes and random etc like most high school anime (I already triggered the FranXX fanboys, don't want another group to come after me so I won't give examples now) because from the very first episode itself, everyone is dating. Yes. You read that right. They're dating from the first episode itself and they're adults and they're Otakus. Reasons enough for why it's so fantastic?Still not convinced? How about I tell you that in spite of having such a unique setup, it handles it excellently? Convinced? I sure do hope you are, because I still have more to say. I haven't even gone to the characters in detail yet! Hirotaka might seem like your dense that you see in most high school romance but NO. Do not underestimate him because he is sharp. I mean, the ending of episode 1 changed my view of him from the get go. Surprised? I was too! He continued to be brilliant like the rest of the cast. Narumi on the other hand is fortunately not a flat female character (I just love making that pun) as we see in some romance anime and much like Hirotaka, is just a joy to watch. She's cute, relatable, and is a perfect matchup for Hirotaka. Then we got the polar opposites, Hana-chan and Gintoki- I mean Bakaku- I mean Kabakura. Both were the most loveable lovebirds and sworn enemies, which was a sharp contrast to Hirotaka and Narumi and offered an excellent balance to the aforementioned pair. Though MAL marked them as Supporting Characters they're very much main characters as well since they're a main focus of the anime too! And that's not to mention the other supporting cast too, they're cute too and the biggest part is that even though they're a supporting cast, the brief moments they feature in were all relatable and enjoyable in their own regard and this was me trying my hardest to describe how lovable the cast is, I can't find the words to describe what I feel to the exact point but this should serve as a somewhat great substitute.STILL NOT CONVINCED? Then I can bring up the last of my cards, the artstyle. Many scorned and scoffed at the name of the studio when they first saw it's synopsis since it was made by A-1 Pictures. A studio that is designed for freelancers. What many realised later was that fortunately this was one of those “once in a blue baboon” situations where they turned out to be good, and I'm talking from the perspective of people who don't like A-1 but are objective critics. Me? Well, much like the other fans, I just enjoyed this. I have liked A-1’s many other works before in particular the Working! series and this just adds on to the fun.Coming back to the topic, it's artstyle was unique, vibrant, cheerful and not to mention adorable. There was just that some thing about it that made it such a joy to look at, whether you're watching it in 1080p, 720p, a CR free subscriber, or the 144p master race (is the show even available in this resolution? Maybe in YouTube). Needless to say it's artstyle is YET another plus point the anime had.It's very very tough to find negatives in this anime and the ones I found were that perhaps it's comedy didn't hit me every single time, though it did usually, I perhaps laughed at least once every episode and just longed for the next week’s episode to come out already and when it did, oh the joy I had.Overall, I don't think I need to point this out, but Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii is a romance anime that you definitely must watch if you're a fan of the genre or are looking for that fun Slice of Life anime to entertain and cosy up to. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this is my pick for Anime of the Year or to the extreme minimum, Romance/SoL of the Year. Romance? Yes. Otaku stuff? Yes, but that isn't too deep for someone to get bored with. End product? Something great that anyone and everyone can watch and enjoy! Yes. Even normies :PYou and I might not see eye to eye on the anime, but I'm sure you'll leave the anime with a smile, that is, if you love watching fun shows. Much like with everyone, you'll definitely find out that you struck a chord with a lot of the things in the anime. I mean, we're all Otakus aren't we?P.S: That last episode man. Incorporated everything that was great in the previous episodes and brought out the best from them to make for a fantastic end to a fantastic anime. If I were to describe Wotakoi in one word, it would ironically be that it's inclusive despite it's otaku centered focus.

"I’m honestly enjoying this anime so much, I look forward to the next episode every week.‘Love is hard for otaku’ to me, is a simple, funny and cute series with some references here and there, displaying the struggles and benefits of relationships between otaku, whether it’s just a friendly relationship or something more.The main characters all have their own characteristics and interests and lets be real, Hirotaka is hella cute I am shaking. Anyways! The relationships between the mc’s are developing as they get to know each other more and more and I am truly enjoying that journey, especially the little fights between Hanako and...Tarou.If you’re looking for something laid back yet cute and funny (and at times relatable), then I’d really recommend watching this. This is definitely my favourite out of the new anime airing this season.ps: I rated this with a 10 because I mainly rate anime based on how much I enjoy watching it so there's that!",im honestly enjoying anime much look forward next episode every weeklove hard otaku simple funny cute series reference displaying struggle benefit relationship otaku whether friendly relationship something morethe main character characteristic interest let real hirotaka hella cute shaking anyways relationship mc developing get know truly enjoying journey especially little fight hanako andtarouif youre looking something laid back yet cute funny time relatable id really recommend watching definitely favourite new anime airing seasonps rated mainly rate anime based much enjoy watching there,positive,0.1868801652892562,0.5403040141676505
"I'm surprised there aren't more people disappointed by this show. And while I am in no way someone who thinks that a faithful adaptation is required to make a good show (see: maid dragon), I think this anime really misses the mark.Starting with the basics, the animation is distractingly bad. This show definitely probably wouldn't require the large animation budget a lot of other shows need (except possibly some of the in game shots later), they definitely cut it back to the bare minimum: lots of still reaction shots, background art that seems disconnected from the foreground characters, and oh my god the faces....The faces seem like they were outsourced to a country where people's eyes wander around their face more than the plot in a bad fanfic.Jokes aside, the story and characters are where this anime loses any hope of redemption. The manga isn't funny or sweet purely through the ""nerd-culture"" content of its jokes, but because the character interaction and great pacing make you feel connected to it. This is a story about people looking to be accepted and wanting to belong, and reading the manga provides a unique feeling of belonging along with them. In stark contrast, this anime feels amazingly routine: uninspired direction causes the character interactions and jokes to fall flat and overall the immersion is totally lost.I cannot enumerate my disappointment in this show; I was really looking forward to it. There's so much missed opportunity for something amazing, but in the end, this story feels like just one out of a thousand generic anime romcoms. If you're looking for something like this show, Net-juu no Susume's anime walks all over this.",im surprised arent people disappointed show way someone think faithful adaptation required make good show see maid dragon think anime really miss markstarting basic animation distractingly bad show definitely probably wouldnt require large animation budget lot show need except possibly game shot later definitely cut back bare minimum lot still reaction shot background art seems disconnected foreground character oh god facesthe face seem like outsourced country people eye wander around face plot bad fanficjokes aside story character anime loses hope redemption manga isnt funny sweet purely nerdculture content joke character interaction great pacing make feel connected story people looking accepted wanting belong reading manga provides unique feeling belonging along stark contrast anime feel amazingly routine uninspired direction cause character interaction joke fall flat overall immersion totally losti enumerate disappointment show really looking forward there much missed opportunity something amazing end story feel like one thousand generic anime romcoms youre looking something like show netjuu susumes anime walk,positive,0.021889400921659,0.4810291858678955
"Who had enough of looking for a fulfilling romance in anime? Who got tired of the school-setting romance with dense characters that don't acknowledge their feelings until the last minute of the anime and they don't even hug or share a kiss? I don't know about you, but I have had enough!I tried a lot of romance anime in search of one that has the characters confess in the beginning and then the remaining of the series is them developing their relationship. But I was always disappointed. That is until I came across Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii.In the beginning, I tried watching the first...episode just to reconcile my hopeless relationship with romance animes. I went in with low expectations but that first episode threw me off guard!A confession in the first episode! I hope I wasn't dreaming! I replayed those two minutes until I believed my eyes, and my heart felt, for the first time in a very long while, full.I grew accustomed to getting disappointed in things that start off too good, so I went to the second episode reluctantly. It just got better.The anime revolves around two relationships. We get glances at how two 'otaku' couples live their everyday life at work, how they get through their days, how they support each other, and most importantly, we see glances of their love for each other and it's the cutest thing I have witnessed in a while. It has got a light-hearted comedy to complement everything and it works so well with the setting.This is a very wholesome anime. It doesn't have the forced drama, the unnecessary love triangle, the frustrating misunderstandings that could have been solved with talking, the teen angst. It is a pure romance comedy to lighten your mood and make you feel good after a shitty day. It is a win to the romance genre.",enough looking fulfilling romance anime got tired schoolsetting romance dense character dont acknowledge feeling last minute anime dont even hug share kiss dont know enoughi tried lot romance anime search one character confess beginning remaining series developing relationship always disappointed came across wotaku ni koi wa muzukashiiin beginning tried watching firstepisode reconcile hopeless relationship romance anime went low expectation first episode threw guarda confession first episode hope wasnt dreaming replayed two minute believed eye heart felt first time long fulli grew accustomed getting disappointed thing start good went second episode reluctantly got betterthe anime revolves around two relationship get glance two otaku couple live everyday life work get day support importantly see glance love cutest thing witnessed got lighthearted comedy complement everything work well settingthis wholesome anime doesnt forced drama unnecessary love triangle frustrating misunderstanding could solved talking teen angst pure romance comedy lighten mood make feel good shitty day win romance genre,positive,0.06044372294372294,0.4944444444444444
"Are u sick of all those high school setting romance show? Did u just finish ur job feeling tired trying to find some refreshment? Look no further as Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi) has got u covered. This is a very laid back show, if youre already have enough of the action shows this season provides with us, heres one that ill highly recommend for anyone who is up for their time.Wotakoi is a very well done rom-com series set in modern day Japan, covering our fellow otaku MCs, and otaku side characters. As aforementioned, our MCs are otakus, they like anime,...just like we all do. The story starts of with our female MC, Momose getting (almost) late for her new job, whilst being scared that her identity as an otaku will be found out by her new coworker. While being shown around the new environment of the office, she found herself coincidentally bumping into her old friend, Hirotaka, our male MC. At first the characters might turn u off as they seem very dull, but youll soon realize that they are just normal, very normal to a point that its like real life, a slice of life indeed. Its fun to watch as the characters start unveiling their little bits in life, how the progressed through their 'hardships' and stuff, the show is very engaging, and occasionally throwing references here and there, which ultimately leads into a far more enjoyable experience.Artstyle of Wotakoi is not impressive, but still very clean, polished, its smooth for ur eyes, I doubt anyone will complain about how it looks. I mean, as bad as how sometimes A-1 screw themselves over very badly, this here isnt the case. OST wise, the OP and ED is something ill never skip, they are just too good for not listening/watching. The songs are very good, but mostly the animation in the OP, absolutely fantastic. Its one of those very creative OPs youll ever bump into every now and then, like how the characters rotate with the camera angles, those transitions are just seamless, cocaine for ur eyes. Soundtracks in the anime itself thou doesnt have much of an impression left in me, either I was paying enough attention because of how well the anime is, or they were just there to compliment the show, nothing that memorable, but nothing to complain as well. Overall a very good and clean presentation.Now before I conclude, I rate the shows I watch MOSTLY by enjoyment. If a show is enjoyable, ill give it 8 and above, and thats probably why u might see that I have quite a high mean score for the animes Ive rated.

"Looking for a true romance, one with suspense, fluff, and drama? Then I will make this incredibly clear that this anime is not for you! I feel like I have to make this clear because I went into this anime based on description, genre, and rating expecting a romance and it really did not deliver.It has a lot of good qualities however. Anime and game lovers will find themselves identifying with the characters, and you’ll find yourself laughing at the exaggerated, but still relatable content. The art is also really cute, all the characters are distinct and different despite all being categorized as otaku’s....You get a peek into the lives of otaku’s of all different types, cosplay, crossplay, manga, videogames, anime, bl, etc. The main fandoms are all represented at least briefly. In its purest form, this anime is just about balancing otaku life with work life, that’s it.Still don’t believe me this isn’t a romance? Then I will spoil (but not really) the romance involved in this anime. For starters, the couple gets together by the end of episode one and it’s treated more like a joke. There is only one kiss scene the entire anime and all it is, is a peck (and it’s not even at the end of the series that this happens, so yea...no kiss at the end either) and again, it’s treated more like a joke. There’s really no development shown in the relationship, no misunderstands, or ups and downs. It’s more like two coworkers who share similar interests that happen to be a couple.I will confess that my score may be on the lower end than what this anime deserves. It’s actually a pretty good light-hearted, comedy. The art is cute, the characters are distinct and fun, and I admittedly got some laughs out of it, but I didn’t get what I wanted out of it and thus ended up rather disappointed.",looking true romance one suspense fluff drama make incredibly clear anime feel like make clear went anime based description genre rating expecting romance really deliverit lot good quality however anime game lover find identifying character youll find laughing exaggerated still relatable content art also really cute character distinct different despite categorized otakusyou get peek life otakus different type cosplay crossplay manga videogames anime bl etc main fandom represented least briefly purest form anime balancing otaku life work life thats itstill dont believe isnt romance spoil really romance involved anime starter couple get together end episode one treated like joke one kiss scene entire anime peck even end series happens yeano kiss end either treated like joke there really development shown relationship misunderstands ups down like two coworkers share similar interest happen couplei confess score may lower end anime deserves actually pretty good lighthearted comedy art cute character distinct fun admittedly got laugh didnt get wanted thus ended rather disappointed,positive,0.10967078189300408,0.48693415637860077
"Part of becoming an adult is finding hobbies that enrich our life and fill the time after exhausting days at work. Wotaku centers around 4 main characters who are obssessed with hobbies society frowns upon, some of whom have little to no social skills at all. Momose, the main lead, is obssessed with manga, especially Yaoi, something she's had to hide from all her previous boyfriends and friends. The other 3 aren't much different: Hanako is also into yaoi and cosplay, her boyfriend Kabakura obssesses over yuri and gaming, and Nifuji games almost to the expense of all else. Momose and Nifuji are childhood friends,...and he comes to an idea: they won't have to hide they're both otakus if they date.The art and character models are stock standard for modern anime, and the soundtrack is sufficient but nothing special. There's promise in a story of adult couples who pursue their own hobbies, finding their own group that values what they do. Let's ignore Momose and Hanako's love of fetishized yaoi, or Kabukara's hyper-infantilized yuri, which is opening a can of worms. The major flaw is the characters are engaging as soggy noodles in a watered down broth. The female leads have their boy's love extend into their real life partners, getting excited by any close interactions between the two. They debate in a single scene which one is the top and which is the bottom. The character dynamics revolve around their eccentric hobbies, but we never get more than a superficial glance at those hobbies.But the biggest flaw is the characters seem to not care for each other. Nifuji and Momose's relationship never extends past childhood friends, even after they start dating. She's not particularly attracted to him, and he makes it clear he'd be into a girl with larger breasts. Their relationship and interactions barely progress or regress. It feels like one of convenience and never develops from that. We never really dive into their actual interests, besides passing references and some stock standard online gameplay.Hanako and Kabukara constantly fight when others are around, even if their interactions are much more lukewarm when they're alone together. Hanako's hobbies are probably the most engaging: she's a well-known cosplayer, and diving into the process she designs and creates the costumes could be an excellent story. At least they seem to care for each other, and spend some enjoyable moments together.The entire character dynamic is ""are the straights ok"" the anime. With a stronger cast, a deeper dive into their interests, or a stronger plot, Wotaku could be engaging with an adult cast so desperately needed in romance anime. Instead, we get something that anyone but a hardcore otaku could really enjoy. Wotaku pales in comparison to other stories revolving around otaku like ""Princess Jellyfish"". The dive into online gaming is superficial unlike ""Recovery of an MMO Junkie"". The obsession with yaoi never extends to what we see in ""Kiss Him, Not Me"". It's not particularly bad but it's uninspired at best.",part becoming adult finding hobby enrich life fill time exhausting day work wotaku center around main character obssessed hobby society frown upon little social skill momose main lead obssessed manga especially yaoi something shes hide previous boyfriend friend arent much different hanako also yaoi cosplay boyfriend kabakura obssesses yuri gaming nifuji game almost expense else momose nifuji childhood friendsand come idea wont hide theyre otakus datethe art character model stock standard modern anime soundtrack sufficient nothing special there promise story adult couple pursue hobby finding group value let ignore momose hanakos love fetishized yaoi kabukaras hyperinfantilized yuri opening worm major flaw character engaging soggy noodle watered broth female lead boy love extend real life partner getting excited close interaction two debate single scene one top bottom character dynamic revolve around eccentric hobby never get superficial glance hobbiesbut biggest flaw character seem care nifuji momos relationship never extends past childhood friend even start dating shes particularly attracted make clear hed girl larger breast relationship interaction barely progress regress feel like one convenience never develops never really dive actual interest besides passing reference stock standard online gameplayhanako kabukara constantly fight others around even interaction much lukewarm theyre alone together hanakos hobby probably engaging shes wellknown cosplayer diving process design creates costume could excellent story least seem care spend enjoyable moment togetherthe entire character dynamic straight ok anime stronger cast deeper dive interest stronger plot wotaku could engaging adult cast desperately needed romance anime instead get something anyone hardcore otaku could really enjoy wotaku pale comparison story revolving around otaku like princess jellyfish dive online gaming superficial unlike recovery mmo junkie obsession yaoi never extends see kiss particularly bad uninspired best,positive,0.09702605570530098,0.42938454627133865
"What makes a good romcom anime?CharactersComedyNarrativeRelationships...DramaRomanceTheses are the things that usually make a romcom anime better not always good though. In the Spring 18 anime season there were two romcom that were strangely competing with each other. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku. Both of these show uses all of these elements that I just listed to make theses respective shows better but yet only one of them was good though.3D Kanojo Real Girl is a badly written romcom where only it had characters would talk over with each other without letting the other person finish but at various times the show hardly feels like a romcom as the show feels like more like a shitty slice of life anime set in high school. Not to mention the portrayal of Otaku culture as well the characterization and relationships were handled very poorly to a point where point where you just want to headbang a table.Thankfully its competitor WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku did not suffer from any of the problems that caused 3D Kanojo Real Girl to become such a horrendous romcom anime and as a result WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku became the best romcom of 2018. Not the best anime of 2018 but still a pretty great one.So what made this romcom so great you may ask?You gonna to find out soon enough.Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku and with that said and done let's get started.Story.The story follows a female officer worker Narumi who secretly hides her Fujoshi lifestyle from her co-workers. One day at work she is reunited with her gaming geek childhood Hirotaka after discovering that they work at the same company. After some drinking sessions outside of work they start to date each other but will it end up being a perfect relationship for theses two or will they fall apart.I really liked the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.For starters the show does a great at establishing its characters right from the first episode.  Unlike 3D Kanojo Real Girl where that show establishes the two main characters in a contrived and silly way Wotakoi decides to establish its main cast in a more mature where in the very first scene of the show where Narumi begins chatting kindly to Hirotaka. Unlike 3D Kanojo where by now both leads would talk over each other and random crap we actually to hear Narumi inner thoughts were we find out this is all a front to keep her secret from being exposed. Hirotaka end ups only partially revealing her secret but it quickly hard cuts to them drinking together. Not only does the show do a great job at presenting its actions that they were both otaku's but it manages to respect the tone of the office setting. The thing that sold me in this show is how the how portrays its romance because you see in real life there’s always a time and place where you can date as the two love birds in the show actually don’t date with each other until a day of work is over. Meaning when Hirotaka and Naruni are not working they are dating.Like with any good romcom the show uses it comedy and romance elements right allowing us to really relate to every comedic and romance conversation that's goes along.The show also a great job at portraying the Otaku culture where it showcases the highs and lows being an Otaku as an adult age. Not to mention the show goes a great job with it's references to video games and anime like Monster Hunter, Mario Kart,  JoJo etcThe one thing that this show over most romcom that are coming out in recently is how the show doesn't take place at high school. Don't get me wrong I like my fair share of anime that were set in high school but in recent memory the high school setting itself was getting too abused to a point where some shows that would have been better if the shows were not in high school.  I know this doesn’t really make a romcom show but for this case it does because we get to see a romance that is in a more mature setting that it has its own rules to follow.Overall the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great.9/10Characters.The characters in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku pretty good for the most part.Our female romcom lead Narumi is a pretty good character. Despite trying to hide her Otaku interests from her workmates she’s actually a nice and passion girl who loves Otaku hobbies. However I have one sight problem with her and that she can a hypocritical at times where there was a piece of dialogue where Hirotaka asks Narumi why she hasn't tried dating someone who understands Otaku, she replies that only another Otaku would understand and Otaku are gross, so she won't do it. Am sorry but why would you deny a man who also an Otaku. If anything I thought date him because you both love the Otaku culture. Thankfully she becomes a better character later where she accepts dating with Hirotaka a man who is an Otaku but at there were times she can be bit cringe-worthy. Minus her slight cringly attitude at times I liked Narumi for the most part.Hirotaka is probably the best character in the series. Unlike Narumi he doesn’t even bother hiding that being a Otaku as he is seen doing Otaku things in the open and he’s not a shamed of it.The character chemistry for Narumi and Hirotaka is nothing but brilliant as they talk they time to understand each by doing all of these Otaku act’s outside of work life.Hanako and Tarou are two characters that I liked. Unlike Hirotaka and Narumi they relationship is a rocky one as they constantly like having a go with each other like enemies most of the time. While they are not as memorable as the main two couple I thought they were still enjoyable characters.Overall the characters were pretty good and enjoyable.8/10Visuals.For a romcom anime this shows looks great. A1 Pictures did a awesome at capturing the setting of the series with it's nice use of business colour pallets that blends in well the shows great character and appealing designs. This is by far the best looking anime I have seen from A1 Pictures and it's not even a shounen series while most of those shows would have decent to average visuals at best. Honestly if A1 Pictures had more anime in this style for they action series then those shows would have been least Bones/J.C Staff tier instead of looking at they just came out from McDonalds unfinished filled with art failures.The animation is pretty nice and smooth for what it is so that’s that.8/10Sound.The soundtrack in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great overall as it does a great at capturing the tone and setting of the series.Both the opening and ending themes of the show are very good and memorable.The voice acting is top notch overall. All the Seyiuss did a great job with the roles that were given.9/10Final Thoughts.Overall this show was just great romcom to start to finish.The story was great, the romance was excellent, and comedy was great and well executed. The characters are great where they all likeable in they own ways. The visuals were surprisingly great and appealing and the soundtrack was beautiful.Despite being only 11 episodes this show was still able to be a better and well thought out romcom anime then the likes of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san and 3D Kanojo Real Girl. It may not be my favourite romcom series ever but I was still one hell of a good one.If you’re looking for a great romcom anime that explores the Otaku culture in a realistic way that I recommend WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.Final Score 8.5/10",make good romcom animecharacterscomedynarrativerelationshipsdramaromancetheses thing usually make romcom anime better always good though spring anime

"Wotakoi is a romance between young adults. Gamer guy who wears glasses and yaoi fangirl who acts like a tomboy. Apparently they aren't very confident about their own hobbies so naturally they go and announce their otaku lifestyle in a manner similar to ""yes, I am a vegan"" meme. Pretty cool.There are few things I quite like. Wotakoi has very direct dialogue, People say what they think and don't hide inside their shells. These characters are honest and don't spend 15 episodes pondering over how to convey. The comedy -especially after the first 2 episodes- is genius. The series is full of gamer memes...that feel very accurate to 90's kids (which our main characters also are). Episode 3 is a perfect example of rom-com done right.The main characters don't feel very special nor memorable. They are just normal, realistic folks who are doing the slice of life thingy. Arguably very smart choice when considering the nature of this series. Still, I found myself getting attached to them in just 2 episodes, and am already looking forward to seeing where their relationship will head. The actual romance between them is super cute and innocent. The overall execution makes Wotakoi seem like a feel-good series.At first, the side characters seem pretty dull, and come off quite comedic, but soon turns out they are pretty much the same as our main pair, just not in the lead role in this series. This is something to which I typically pay a lot attention, but this time our side characters are actually real characters and not filler people. I can appreciate that.The art and animation are rather typical. Nothing note-worthy in terms of good or bad. It has chosen the safe route, which is fine. The seiyuus consist of some big names, but none which voice I have yet grown tired of hearing, so I have no problems with that. When it comes to the OST, I have been too busy giggling at the cute romance scenes so I completely did not pay attention to any of the songs or if there even were any present. I only recall the video game BGM from episode 1. The series made a good job on making me forget that I was watching an anime. This is pretty much the perfect prove -for myself at least- that it is a decent show.",wotakoi romance young adult gamer guy wear glass yaoi fangirl act like tomboy apparently arent confident hobby naturally go announce otaku lifestyle manner similar yes vegan meme pretty coolthere thing quite like wotakoi direct dialogue people say think dont hide inside shell character honest dont spend episode pondering convey comedy especially first episode genius series full gamer memesthat feel accurate kid main character also episode perfect example romcom done rightthe main character dont feel special memorable normal realistic folk slice life thingy arguably smart choice considering nature series still found getting attached episode already looking forward seeing relationship head actual romance super cute innocent overall execution make wotakoi seem like feelgood seriesat first side character seem pretty dull come quite comedic soon turn pretty much main pair lead role series something typically pay lot attention time side character actually real character filler people appreciate thatthe art animation rather typical nothing noteworthy term good bad chosen safe route fine seiyuus consist big name none voice yet grown tired hearing problem come ost busy giggling cute romance scene completely pay attention song even present recall video game bgm episode series made good job making forget watching anime pretty much perfect prove least decent show,positive,0.2087706511175898,0.5604956268221575
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (or simply Wotakoi), have two genres. Comedy and romance. That's it. Romcoms nowadays in the anime community has been popular in the late 2010's sparking a big genre called ''School''.Yet Im not talking about the ''School'' genre here. Im talking about how Wotakoi done an excellent job on progressing and making unique attempts on a Romantic-comedy segment that is surprisingly not taking place in a high school. Instead it follows the workplace of four unique characters. Unique as in every single one of this four have unique attributes that you can say ''How in the world does this four have...a partner with their attitudes?''.The story revolves mainly on the four characters of the show. Inspite of that, each episode offers uniqueness and heart-warming scenes that can make either audience feel comfortable or laugh at. It mainly focus on the lives of Nifuji Hirotaka (the quiet, not that sociable gamer), Momose Narumi (the cute, sparkling otaku and yaoi fan), Kabakura Tarou (the guy you always meet in the bar who looks like a thug but has a genuine heart) and Koyanagi Hanako (the cosplaying-loving woman and the only one who can stand-up against Kabakura.) Each episodes offers rare shots from a Rom-com like any other. Instead of doing classwork, they do office work. They are not students. They are adults. The fact that Wotakoi stands out this season is that its not like your typical high school drama like Tada-kun this season. It shows the picture of office workers and adulthood. The one thing that made this anime different to our ''in-real-life'' adulthood is that, Wotakoi still offers the taste of an otaku. Whether your a figurine collector, gamer, yaoi fan, manga fan or an anime fan, you can relate to either one or two or even every single character from these four and will make you laugh out loud. Its not only the environment is unique. The love story of this four as well. The fact that each character, have different taste, interest and attitude made them understand each other is truly inspiring. That is what you call friendship. Real friendship and that exist on the adulthood. I'm not against to the current status of Rom-coms on anime being on a high school environment. I mean some are good. Some are average. Although one thing is certain.. is that Wotakoi can upgrade the romantic-comedy segment into a whole new level.Every anime comes down into judging it by art, and Wotakoi, in all honesty, made it average on my opinion. Average although watchable. You don't need a very good animation for a romantic-comedy and all. This is not action. Although I would love to note that the animation used in the gaming episode and the opening is excellent.Speaking of the opening, this is one of those openings I added to my anime playlists because its just too good. Along with the animation and the dance (hands) choreography on the chorus of the opening, it is a great way to start off the episode. The ending as well. With its art picturing the characters like going home from a busy day of work to sleeping, with a cheerful singing, its just fit to the theme of Wotakoi.Overall, this anime when I first saw it on the PV or trailer, I was expecting it to be a good take for romance and comedy genre and I was not disappointed going through the 11 episodes. Wotakoi is good uptake of the genre and I rated it this high because of its story, mixing it with well-developed characters, fine animation, heart-warming openings and endings, and a good comedic material.",wotaku ni koi wa muzukashii simply wotakoi two genre comedy romance thats romcoms nowadays anime community popular late sparking big genre called schoolyet im talking school genre im talking wotakoi done excellent job progressing making unique attempt romanticcomedy segment surprisingly taking place high school instead follows workplace four unique character unique every single one four unique attribute say world four havea partner attitudesthe story revolves mainly four character show inspite episode offer uniqueness heartwarming scene make either audience feel comfortable laugh mainly focus life nifuji hirotaka quiet sociable gamer momose narumi cute sparkling otaku yaoi fan kabakura tarou guy always meet bar look like thug genuine heart koyanagi hanako cosplayingloving woman one standup kabakura episode offer rare shot romcom like instead classwork office work student adult fact wotakoi stand season like typical high school drama like tadakun season show picture office worker adulthood one thing made anime different inreallife adulthood wotakoi still offer taste otaku whether figurine collector gamer yaoi fan manga fan anime fan relate either one two even every single character four make laugh loud environment unique love story four well fact character different taste interest attitude made understand truly inspiring call friendship real friendship exist adulthood im current status romcoms anime high school environment mean good average although one thing certain wotakoi upgrade romanticcomedy segment whole new levelevery anime come judging art wotakoi honesty made average opinion average although watchable dont need good animation romanticcomedy action although would love note animation used gaming episode opening excellentspeaking opening one opening added anime playlist good along animation dance hand choreography chorus opening great way start episode ending well art picturing character like going home busy day work sleeping cheerful singing fit theme wotakoioverall anime first saw pv trailer expecting good take romance comedy genre disappointed going episode wotakoi good uptake genre rated high story mixing welldeveloped character fine animation heartwarming opening ending good comedic material,positive,0.25164255335307956,0.5647810814916079

"Wotaku ni koi muzukashii (or Wotakoi for short) is a really nice and cute anime.Now I have seen some comments saying that this anime has no plot and is just the daily lives of some otaku people. Have you not heard of Slice of Life? This is very much a slice of life, it has little to no plot but is just stuff that happens nearly on the daily. It is nice.The comedy also nicely hits, usually, if an anime is boring I find myself skipping a lot, but this anime I do not skip times so that is good.The story is about these...4 people, and they are otakus (nerds). One of them like Yaoi, one is a cosplayer, one loves video games, one loves collecting idols, etc. There are 2 couples in those people, and they are very open about their nerdiness in front of each other. It is very wholesome.This anime appeases the otaku fandom and romanticizes them in my opinion. Sure nothing wrong with loving a hobby, but being that engrossed in something to the point where it affects your relationship is wild and is romanticized here.The music is nice.OP is really really good, music is nice and all but OP animation is amazing.Animation quality is also really good. I liked it.Overall really nice show!8/10 still not really life-changing as I would give 9 or 10/10's.

Full disclaimer, I dropped it after watching 6 episodes.MC - Main CharacterFMC - Female Main CharacterThis is not a romance anime even though it has the romance tag. The pathetic amount of romance it has is pretty one-sided and goes nowhere.Someone needs to tell these mangakas that there needs to be progress and not at a turtle speed. I mean, the premise was good, but I was expecting the main couple to start developing feelings for one another over time but that never happened.By the 6 episode, it was clear to me that the...MC liked the FMC but there was no sign of romantic interest from the FMC side. Hell, she treated other male characters better than she did the MC, and on top of that, it was pretty clear that the MC wasn't even her type, meaning she was not attracted to him, which is fine by me but ONLY if it slowly starts to change. Sadly, as I said, it did not.Overall: I was pretty disappointed because I did not get what I wanted from the show. One-sided love is not fun to watch especially if it does not develop into something more. A rom-com that has VERY little romance.Recommendation: Skip it. There are far better rom-coms out there such as Kamisama Hajimemashita.",hate long review im gon na make short full disclaimer dropped watching episodesmc main characterfmc female main characterthis romance anime even though romance tag pathetic amount romance pretty onesided go nowheresomeone need tell mangakas need progress turtle speed mean premise good expecting main couple start developing feeling one another time never happenedby episode clear themc liked fmc sign romantic interest fmc side hell treated male character better mc top pretty clear mc wasnt even type meaning attracted fine slowly start change sadly said notoverall pretty disappointed get wanted show onesided love fun watch especially develop something romcom little romancerecommendation skip far better romcoms kamisama hajimemashita,positive,0.06505376344086021,0.587768817204301
"I'm wondering what's happening with slice of life shows lately.It's as if anime producers had a secret consensus, and on it they decided they'll sneak in non-existent plot into shows, and focus on making money with as little effort as possible. News flash: just because a show has slice of life genre in it, it doesn't allow it to be boring to the point of being a comatose-inducing drug.I can give you endless examples of other shows being super interesting regardless of main theme simply tracking a character or characters' lives or other barely existing plot examples. Wotakoi went off rails with plot less than...mid-way through, and decided to show filler episodes instead.Now, I haven't read the manga and perhaps it's different in it, but it doesn't excuse the poor, or rather, a complete lack of pacing and direction, resulting in my lack of engagement.Slightly annoying factor is that the shows such as this one somehow get a pass by an average person's critique and are now considered quality shows, when they are not. I get that by making the setting as uncomplicated as possible, you know, just a regular present day, no supernatural circumstances, or no deep psychological battle mysteries like known to all Death Note, no melodrama or different harem routes, none of that shit, it's guaranteed to avoid pretty much any illogical executions, events, inconsistencies or plot holes, like many action series suffer from for example, but there's no excuse for having a lack of guidance altogether and just call it quits.Atmosphere is lovely, characters are sympathetic, it's bundled in nice, shiny wrappings, the overall presentation is great, yet it ultimately fails to deliver any conclusion, it's too tedious and lacks life. I'm sorry but this will not go unnoticed by some people, myself included.I don't hate this show by a long shot, but I don't know how and/or why do these types of shows always leave a bad taste in my mouth.",im wondering whats happening slice life show latelyits anime producer secret consensus decided theyll sneak nonexistent plot show focus making money little effort possible news flash show slice life genre doesnt allow boring point comatoseinducing drugi give endless example show super interesting regardless main theme simply tracking character character life barely existing plot example wotakoi went rail plot less thanmidway decided show filler episode insteadnow havent read manga perhaps different doesnt excuse poor rather complete lack pacing direction resulting lack engagementslightly annoying factor show one somehow get pas average person critique considered quality show get making setting uncomplicated possible know regular present day supernatural circumstance deep psychological battle mystery like known death note melodrama different harem route none shit guaranteed avoid pretty much illogical execution event inconsistency plot hole like many action series suffer example there excuse lack guidance altogether call quitsatmosphere lovely character sympathetic bundled nice shiny wrapping overall presentation great yet ultimately fails deliver conclusion tedious lack life im sorry go unnoticed people includedi dont hate show long shot dont know andor type show always leave bad taste mouth,negative,-0.05377906976744186,0.5321875798619984
"TL;DR It's a 7/10 show that is not meant for everyone. If romcoms are not your genre or want a romance that heavily focuses on development like Tsuki ga Kirei, then I wouldn't recommend it. The humor is good. The Opening is probably the best this season. However, I don't think the 3 episode rule applies here, if you don't like Romantic-Comedies.Wotakoi is a romantic-comedy that steps into the light of adulthood, and basks in the glory of being an Otaku? I'm just kidding. Being an otaku in society is still seen as a overall negative from all the weird things like Hentai and Cosplay...making people seem deranged for dressing as weird fantasy characters...BUT THAT'S GETTING OFF TOPIC. Anyways, Wotakoi is a light-hearted anime that really brings out what makes the romcom scene enjoyable. The character dynamics between all three of the couples: Narumi x Hirotaka ; Kabakura x Koyanagi ; Naoya x Kou, add a level of chemistry and flavor that never steps into disturbing or overbearing with its amount of fluff.Those who are expecting a fully-developed story with lots of romantic progression or character development are going to be sadly disappointed though. Neither of those elements get pushed forward. But, that isn't mean they aren't nurtured. Throughout the entire 11 episodes, the emotions and affection that we see nurtured throughout the entire series, while small, are noticeably different from episode 1 to the ending.Is this a show that everyone should watch? No. I don't think everyone is going to enjoy Wotakoi. It's an anime that feels like it was produced and developed for people like myself who grew up with Romantic-Comedies, and understand that speed is an aspect that rarely happens within these shows.",tldr show meant everyone romcoms genre want romance heavily focus development like tsuki ga kirei wouldnt recommend humor good opening probably best season however dont think episode rule applies dont like romanticcomedieswotakoi romanticcomedy step light adulthood basks glory otaku im kidding otaku society still seen overall negative weird thing like hentai cosplaymaking people seem deranged dressing weird fantasy charactersbut thats getting topic anyways wotakoi lighthearted anime really brings make romcom scene enjoyable character dynamic three couple narumi x hirotaka kabakura x koyanagi naoya x kou add level chemistry flavor never step disturbing overbearing amount fluffthose expecting fullydeveloped story lot romantic progression character development going sadly disappointed though neither element get pushed forward isnt mean arent nurtured throughout entire episode emotion affection see nurtured throughout entire series small noticeably different episode endingis show everyone watch dont think everyone going enjoy wotakoi anime feel like produced developed people like grew romanticcomedies understand speed aspect rarely happens within show,positive,0.013068181818181812,0.5524621212121212
"Ok, so I tried so hard to like this show, I did. I fell in love with megane, (the show is so dreadful I only remember two people's names and they are side characters) at first but then he became so dull as a person, and not because of the cold-monotone personality they were trying to go for. He just was.Pink Hair chick, Momose (I had to open the info tab to get their names), is annoying, loud, and on more than one occasion admits she isn't attracted to her boyfriend. Now they go over this in the show where it could be a relationship...of convenience, (yes, yes it is), but it doesn't get resolved. These two have known each other since childhood, yet this moron doesn't know enough about him to be considered an acquaintance. I had to watch this more than once in case I missed things, sadly, I didn't.Now Gingertoki (Kabakura) and Green Haired chick (Hanako) are like the worst example of a couple. Now, everyone has arguments here and there, especially when both people are stubborn, but f***ing dammit. Him calling her a hag is not cute. Her forcing him to do things isn't cute. They get into a fight and it doesn't even get resolved and it pisses me off. It's unhealthy this type of arguing. They only gave them a couple of good eps and even then it didn't last. Like before it became 100% established that they were dating they were better with each other, then it's made clear and they're at each other's throats just for breathing weird. There is so much they have to work on for a couple that's been together for a decade.It was hard for me to believe that Hirotaka ever had a thing for this dumb chick since childhood. Like it all seemed forced.For all those people that loved it for not being the high school show where it takes ages for the couple to admit their feelings, you have been tricked with this show. These two dated because ""why not we're both otakus"" (worst reason), and throughout the show they couldn't admit their feelings. He didn't tell her how long he liked her for, she was still uncertain of the whole relationship the whole damn time, she was still not attracted to him until he removed his glasses and other chicks wanted him. Saying she hadn't seen him like that. Honestly, I can barely see them as friends. It's not that they're going slow, there is no fucking chemistry, hell there was more chemistry with Momose  (I did it, I remembered a name without having to look back) and Naoya. This whole show was Momose wondering if she loved Megane. They are literally acting like those kids that think they should date because they have things in common, but they really shouldn't because they just don't mesh well. So it is another high school show where the lead couple won't admit their feelings or act on them. It's just been dressed up differently.Now the one thing that wasn't resolved and I fear it will be for  season 2 that this show doesn't deserve, is the relationship with Naoya and Kou. Now those two were believable as a potential couple. It's like the writers spent more time making those two likable. Those seriously are the only ones I'm rooting for and even like. If there is a season 2, I won't watch it,  but at least resolve something.I give Garbagetaku a 2/10 only bc I love Naoya and Kou.",ok tried hard like show fell love megane show dreadful remember two people name side character first became dull person coldmonotone personality trying go waspink hair chick momose open info tab get name annoying loud one occasion admits isnt attracted boyfriend go show could relationshipof convenience yes yes doesnt get resolved two known since childhood yet moron doesnt know enough considered acquaintance watch case missed thing sadly didntnow gingertoki kabakura green haired chick hanako like worst example couple everyone argument especially people stubborn fing dammit calling hag cute forcing thing isnt cute get fight doesnt even get resolved piss unhealthy type arguing gave couple good eps even didnt last like became established dating better made clear theyre others throat breathing weird much work couple thats together decadeit hard believe hirotaka ever thing dumb chick since childhood like seemed forcedfor people loved high school show take age couple admit feeling tricked show two dated otakus worst reason throughout show couldnt admit feeling didnt tell long liked still uncertain whole relationship whole damn time still attracted removed glass chick wanted saying hadnt seen like honestly barely see friend theyre going slow fucking chemistry hell chemistry momose remembered name without look back naoya whole show momose wondering loved megane literally acting like kid think date thing common really shouldnt dont mesh well another high school show lead couple wont admit feeling act dressed differentlynow one thing wasnt resolved fear season show doesnt deserve relationship naoya kou two believable potential couple like writer spent time making two likable seriously one im rooting even like season wont watch least resolve somethingi give garbagetaku bc love naoya kou,negative,-0.01826666666666667,0.5762666666666666
