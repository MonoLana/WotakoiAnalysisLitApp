Review
"Growing up from a kid to adulthood, I’m sure all of us has our own favorite hobbies, interests, or dirty little secret. Not many people like to admit it but it’s part of our society and how we live in. For a show about the otaku culture and exploring the lifestyle of the nerd norm, Wotake ni Koi wa Muzukashii really set the bar high. Welcome to a world where office romance, otakuism, and gaming culture become an experience you won’t forget.The English translation title is “It’s Difficult to Love an Otaku” and “Love is Hard of Otaku”. Literally, those words mushed up together already...feels like the show is a big joke or satire. While the show seems like it’s taking a risk at mixing a variety of questionable gimmicks together, I can say safely that there’s no need to worry. As a fan of the manga, I was thrilled to learn that Noitamina was chosen to air this show. It seems fitting for such an anime based on their history of lineups. What’s more is that this show also portrays a more realistic slice of life story that you don’t see too often these days. To me, this was a God-sent gift for Spring 2018.I’m not going to lie. Watching this anime reminds me of being a kid despite the show being targeted at an older audience. The goofy style of the storytelling along with the colorful character cast brings in a very playful atmosphere. Even as the show takes place in an office life environment, it’s hard to ignore the character chemistry between the main cast. From the start, we got two childhood friends named Narumi Momose and Hirotaka Nifuji. The two have known each other for awhile but are almost like complete polar opposites. Narumi is a bubbly outgoing girl with an interest in fujoshi and otome games. On the other hand, Nifuji is an otaku with an avid interest in video games and doesn’t actually seem to care what other thinks of him. Despite their different personalities, it’s undeniable that the two has chemistry both during and off work. The other two lovebirds in the show consists of Hanako Koanagi and Tarou Kabakura. They are dating as a couple and while the two constantly bickers at every chance they get, the two genuinely seems to love each other. Now, you’re probably thinking…is this going to be a show filled with drama and misunderstandings? Absolutely not. While the show contains office romance, it’s hardly a story that focuses on that exclusively. Instead, this anime stands out as a way of exploring the everyday adventures of these characters.One of the primary factors that makes this show appealing is the small character cast. It capitalizes on giving every character a chance to shine without leaving another in the dust. The couple pair of Narumi and Nifuji is infectiously entertaining to watch. Their character chemistry is shown through their interests that somehow intersects with their daily lives. At the office, the two maintains a professional relationship although they still act casually towards each other. The show explores their relationship development as they understand each other more in their adult lives. This even includes going on dates to the movies or amusement park. While the show adapts their relationship more as a ship tease, I think it’s safe that fans accepts them as a couple. Hanako and Tarou are dating already so the show doesn’t hide the fact that they care for each other. It’s mostly lighthearted romance that relies more on realism to do the storytelling. Office romance isn’t easy to adapt but this anime does that without ever being distracting. Characters act the way humans do while drawing connection to their otaku interests. Each of the main characters has their own interest. (otome games, gamer, cosplaying, bishoujo) As a central theme of the show, it establishes their interest through dialogues, interactions, and references. The show often throws in jokes with characters’ small talk and arguing to sell its comedy. It’s damn entertaining as every character gets their moment of fame. It masterfully matches the pacing of the dialogues that feels very real. The impression those moments bring is an accurate depiction of how co-workers behave. Whenever this nerdy group goes out for a drink, they act like casual adults enjoying life. It brings in the sensation of a rom-com between working adults that leaves me satisfied. Oh and before I forget to mention, give the manga a try too. The anime actually expands on some background content but the manga also feels like its own little world.To be honest, A-1 Pictures is the last studio I would imagine adapting this show. However, the production quality itself is vibrant with colorful character designs. The characters looks distinct between one another with their different hair colors and facial expressions. Character reactions also sell a good deal of the comedy especially whenever Narumi reacts in exaggerated manners. As an anime that focuses on otaku, do expect video game references to be made such as the Nintendo Switch and Monster Hunter. There’s even one episode where the characters are adapted into an RPG setting with very gimmicky video game themes.No fan service? No problem. You have the character dialogues doing the talking and most of it delivers humor in the most harmless ways. Yet at the same time, it’s able to create quality entertainment thanks to the talents of the voice cast. Narumi and Hanako in particular are able to bring out the best out of characters through that with their human personalities. The theme songs are also quite creative with their choreography. Namely, the OP song “Fiction” by Sumika is adorably cute with the body language. Every character in the theme songs stands out with their coordinated movements.With 11 episodes, it felt just enough for this anime to do what it’s intended and that’s to sell its ideas to the audience. It succeeds that thanks to its creative circle of characters and their interests. Otakuism is not something that’s accepted easily as a positive culture norm. In fact, it’s often looked down upon in our society. However, this show presented that in a positive way. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the show is recommendable to just about anyone. A show like this deserves more attention, seriously."
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi for short) is a romance comedy which characters are Otakus (Anime or Game Otakus). It is set in an office setting, featuring 4 main characters (2 couples) that are dating each other. Here in there, you would see direct references to manga, anime, games, and the likes. However, this anime fails to deliver well in both comedy and romance. I think it is important for you to treat this more as a slice of life show featuring otaku couples, as to not give any unmet expectations.The romance in this anime is more of just a setting as it is...hardly explored. It will only occasionally throw in some romantic moments. Meanwhile, the jokes in this anime are rarely funny. I feel like the biggest problem to the comedy is the awful timing. It is really slow at delivering punchlines, making it unfunny at most times. To make it worse, there are sometimes short explanations by the game-sounding-narrator, which further slows down the pace.The characters here are not really outstanding. There's no traits or moments that I feel really stand out from them. Also, even though the couples' relationships might change a little, the characters themselves hardly changes.The background music is one problem I have with this anime. Maybe it's just not my taste, but although there are some good tracks, there are a lot of weird tracks that are just slapped unto an unfitting scene (honestly, I don't think those tracks could fit anywhere).Overall, I think this anime fails to deliver a good romcom. There is only a little romance development and jokes fall flat. This is an anime for watching the daily lives of otaku couples. And that's it, since the only thing this anime got going for it is its relatability for people familiar with the otaku culture."
"I picked up Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii along with 3D Kanojo together back when the show first aired and expected both to be about the same, I gave the former an 8 and the latter a 7 originally if my memory doesn't fail me, and from then on even though both featured otaku (now it's obvious that 3D Kanojo only has one while Wotakoi has it's entire casts as the same but I picked it up together for the same reason) it became clear as day which was fresh garbage and which was the anime that made me dance. Looking at the rating I...think you know what show turned out to be the one that made me dance, yes. This is my review of Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii, ikuze!!!Let's start with some backstory. My last seasonal romance watch was in Summer of 2017, almost exactly three seasons ago, which is shocking because if you know me, I love romance and always strive to watch it in some way or the other but in terms of seasonals I felt tired and stopped focusing on the genre. To reasons obvious to romance fans I felt Spring would be the best season for a romance fan to return to the seasonal genre and found a lot of romance anime to watch, but none, absolutely none made me fall over them as much as I fell over Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii. Not because it's cute, but because it's unique, it's fun, and of course, it's got everything else going for it.I mean, look at it's competition this season (or even the last), what romance anime did we have? Tada-kun started strong but suffered with it's cliche problem shortly after, FranXX continues to be complete garbage in the romance category (and dare I say it every other category), the anime I formerly mentioned, 3D Kanojo almost immediately disappointed me with it's second episode, Grancrest had the same FranXX situation, while Beatless could be considered one slot better than the two mentioned. Leaving us with two romance anime this season that continued to be adored by me, Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii and Akkun To Kanojo. The latter was and still is an enjoyable show but being a short, it can't compare to Wotakoi in the same breath. Why? Read on!First off, it's a fantastic slice of life anime. Wotakoi is how you make a Slice of Life Romance work and I can't find any other examples that bettered it till Winter 2017 (when I first started seasonals) and overall I'm sure it'll rank up in my top 5. Yet again you ask why? Because it knows how to captivate it's watchers with warmth. This brings us to the question, why do we watch romance anime? Many would say that it's because it brings them warmth, and surprise, surprise, Wotakoi gives you that. A cute, warm and fuzzy slice of life anime you can cosy up to whether you're single or with your partner. Even though it's centered on Otakus, it's biggest feature is that there's something for everyone.Everyone will find something in the anime worth relating to and laughing at, and I'm just talking about the normies here, if you're a mild anime watcher or a hardcore one, both parties will find lots and lots to laugh at and references to gloss over with this anime. Be it a Dragon Quest reference, a Final Fantasy reference, a Saekano reference, etc etc. There's lots to list and I don't have enough time to list them all for we must move on to the next best part. The soundtrack. I don't think I need to tell you how popular the Opening is especially with it's dance and there's been countless videos on YouTube (some of which were taken down because Sony Music) showing viewers how the dance is done or how they reacted to this marvelous choreography. And that's not to mention the ED as well. Fantastic, cosy and just a joy to watch, it's an excellent example of a testament to the anime.And we've barely scratched the surface. What else makes the anime so fun? The biggest reason why? THE CHARACTERS! I haven't seen such vibrant AND relatable characters in an anime in a very long time and this was just fabulous. I mean, it makes me wanna write on every character. First off, we didn't get one pairup, we got TWO. Then the interactions, motivations, situations, all made for a really cute yet not over the top anime. It didn't overstep its bounds yet created an environment that only Wotakoi could create and excel in. This isn't a Utopia, this is real life, and the real life says Wotakoi is excellent. Speaking of real life, the wonderful staff who worked on this anime. Having renowned VAs like Sawashiro Miyuki and the legendary Sugita Tomokazu himself, this anime wasn't at all short of talent, and the others too did brilliantly. I never for once felt like the voice actors did a bad job, or that the directing or scripting was bad in any way.I might be sounding like I'm fanboying like crazy but let's just say Wotakoi IS that kind of show. It makes you warm and you're left beaming with happiness. Definitely something I'd call a feel-good show. Oh and, another reason why the anime is so amazing? It's got adults. Not high school kids as the main characters and that gives a LOT of room for different scenarios and even though our lovely cast might seem childish, in the first place, being an otaku is a throwback to childhood anyway. And second, we don't have any blushing game of random meetups and random kisses and random blushes and random etc like most high school anime (I already triggered the FranXX fanboys, don't want another group to come after me so I won't give examples now) because from the very first episode itself, everyone is dating. Yes. You read that right. They're dating from the first episode itself and they're adults and they're Otakus. Reasons enough for why it's so fantastic?Still not convinced? How about I tell you that in spite of having such a unique setup, it handles it excellently? Convinced? I sure do hope you are, because I still have more to say. I haven't even gone to the characters in detail yet! Hirotaka might seem like your dense that you see in most high school romance but NO. Do not underestimate him because he is sharp. I mean, the ending of episode 1 changed my view of him from the get go. Surprised? I was too! He continued to be brilliant like the rest of the cast. Narumi on the other hand is fortunately not a flat female character (I just love making that pun) as we see in some romance anime and much like Hirotaka, is just a joy to watch. She's cute, relatable, and is a perfect matchup for Hirotaka. Then we got the polar opposites, Hana-chan and Gintoki- I mean Bakaku- I mean Kabakura. Both were the most loveable lovebirds and sworn enemies, which was a sharp contrast to Hirotaka and Narumi and offered an excellent balance to the aforementioned pair. Though MAL marked them as Supporting Characters they're very much main characters as well since they're a main focus of the anime too! And that's not to mention the other supporting cast too, they're cute too and the biggest part is that even though they're a supporting cast, the brief moments they feature in were all relatable and enjoyable in their own regard and this was me trying my hardest to describe how lovable the cast is, I can't find the words to describe what I feel to the exact point but this should serve as a somewhat great substitute.STILL NOT CONVINCED? Then I can bring up the last of my cards, the artstyle. Many scorned and scoffed at the name of the studio when they first saw it's synopsis since it was made by A-1 Pictures. A studio that is designed for freelancers. What many realised later was that fortunately this was one of those “once in a blue baboon” situations where they turned out to be good, and I'm talking from the perspective of people who don't like A-1 but are objective critics. Me? Well, much like the other fans, I just enjoyed this. I have liked A-1’s many other works before in particular the Working! series and this just adds on to the fun.Coming back to the topic, it's artstyle was unique, vibrant, cheerful and not to mention adorable. There was just that some thing about it that made it such a joy to look at, whether you're watching it in 1080p, 720p, a CR free subscriber, or the 144p master race (is the show even available in this resolution? Maybe in YouTube). Needless to say it's artstyle is YET another plus point the anime had.It's very very tough to find negatives in this anime and the ones I found were that perhaps it's comedy didn't hit me every single time, though it did usually, I perhaps laughed at least once every episode and just longed for the next week’s episode to come out already and when it did, oh the joy I had.Overall, I don't think I need to point this out, but Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii is a romance anime that you definitely must watch if you're a fan of the genre or are looking for that fun Slice of Life anime to entertain and cosy up to. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this is my pick for Anime of the Year or to the extreme minimum, Romance/SoL of the Year. Romance? Yes. Otaku stuff? Yes, but that isn't too deep for someone to get bored with. End product? Something great that anyone and everyone can watch and enjoy! Yes. Even normies :PYou and I might not see eye to eye on the anime, but I'm sure you'll leave the anime with a smile, that is, if you love watching fun shows. Much like with everyone, you'll definitely find out that you struck a chord with a lot of the things in the anime. I mean, we're all Otakus aren't we?P.S: That last episode man. Incorporated everything that was great in the previous episodes and brought out the best from them to make for a fantastic end to a fantastic anime. If I were to describe Wotakoi in one word, it would ironically be that it's inclusive despite it's otaku centered focus. Hirotaka GO!"
"I’m honestly enjoying this anime so much, I look forward to the next episode every week.‘Love is hard for otaku’ to me, is a simple, funny and cute series with some references here and there, displaying the struggles and benefits of relationships between otaku, whether it’s just a friendly relationship or something more.The main characters all have their own characteristics and interests and lets be real, Hirotaka is hella cute I am shaking. Anyways! The relationships between the mc’s are developing as they get to know each other more and more and I am truly enjoying that journey, especially the little fights between Hanako and...Tarou.If you’re looking for something laid back yet cute and funny (and at times relatable), then I’d really recommend watching this. This is definitely my favourite out of the new anime airing this season.ps: I rated this with a 10 because I mainly rate anime based on how much I enjoy watching it so there's that!"
"I'm surprised there aren't more people disappointed by this show. And while I am in no way someone who thinks that a faithful adaptation is required to make a good show (see: maid dragon), I think this anime really misses the mark.Starting with the basics, the animation is distractingly bad. This show definitely probably wouldn't require the large animation budget a lot of other shows need (except possibly some of the in game shots later), they definitely cut it back to the bare minimum: lots of still reaction shots, background art that seems disconnected from the foreground characters, and oh my god the faces....The faces seem like they were outsourced to a country where people's eyes wander around their face more than the plot in a bad fanfic.Jokes aside, the story and characters are where this anime loses any hope of redemption. The manga isn't funny or sweet purely through the ""nerd-culture"" content of its jokes, but because the character interaction and great pacing make you feel connected to it. This is a story about people looking to be accepted and wanting to belong, and reading the manga provides a unique feeling of belonging along with them. In stark contrast, this anime feels amazingly routine: uninspired direction causes the character interactions and jokes to fall flat and overall the immersion is totally lost.I cannot enumerate my disappointment in this show; I was really looking forward to it. There's so much missed opportunity for something amazing, but in the end, this story feels like just one out of a thousand generic anime romcoms. If you're looking for something like this show, Net-juu no Susume's anime walks all over this."
"Who had enough of looking for a fulfilling romance in anime? Who got tired of the school-setting romance with dense characters that don't acknowledge their feelings until the last minute of the anime and they don't even hug or share a kiss? I don't know about you, but I have had enough!I tried a lot of romance anime in search of one that has the characters confess in the beginning and then the remaining of the series is them developing their relationship. But I was always disappointed. That is until I came across Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii.In the beginning, I tried watching the first...episode just to reconcile my hopeless relationship with romance animes. I went in with low expectations but that first episode threw me off guard!A confession in the first episode! I hope I wasn't dreaming! I replayed those two minutes until I believed my eyes, and my heart felt, for the first time in a very long while, full.I grew accustomed to getting disappointed in things that start off too good, so I went to the second episode reluctantly. It just got better.The anime revolves around two relationships. We get glances at how two 'otaku' couples live their everyday life at work, how they get through their days, how they support each other, and most importantly, we see glances of their love for each other and it's the cutest thing I have witnessed in a while. It has got a light-hearted comedy to complement everything and it works so well with the setting.This is a very wholesome anime. It doesn't have the forced drama, the unnecessary love triangle, the frustrating misunderstandings that could have been solved with talking, the teen angst. It is a pure romance comedy to lighten your mood and make you feel good after a shitty day. It is a win to the romance genre."
"Are u sick of all those high school setting romance show? Did u just finish ur job feeling tired trying to find some refreshment? Look no further as Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi) has got u covered. This is a very laid back show, if youre already have enough of the action shows this season provides with us, heres one that ill highly recommend for anyone who is up for their time.Wotakoi is a very well done rom-com series set in modern day Japan, covering our fellow otaku MCs, and otaku side characters. As aforementioned, our MCs are otakus, they like anime,...just like we all do. The story starts of with our female MC, Momose getting (almost) late for her new job, whilst being scared that her identity as an otaku will be found out by her new coworker. While being shown around the new environment of the office, she found herself coincidentally bumping into her old friend, Hirotaka, our male MC. At first the characters might turn u off as they seem very dull, but youll soon realize that they are just normal, very normal to a point that its like real life, a slice of life indeed. Its fun to watch as the characters start unveiling their little bits in life, how the progressed through their 'hardships' and stuff, the show is very engaging, and occasionally throwing references here and there, which ultimately leads into a far more enjoyable experience.Artstyle of Wotakoi is not impressive, but still very clean, polished, its smooth for ur eyes, I doubt anyone will complain about how it looks. I mean, as bad as how sometimes A-1 screw themselves over very badly, this here isnt the case. OST wise, the OP and ED is something ill never skip, they are just too good for not listening/watching. The songs are very good, but mostly the animation in the OP, absolutely fantastic. Its one of those very creative OPs youll ever bump into every now and then, like how the characters rotate with the camera angles, those transitions are just seamless, cocaine for ur eyes. Soundtracks in the anime itself thou doesnt have much of an impression left in me, either I was paying enough attention because of how well the anime is, or they were just there to compliment the show, nothing that memorable, but nothing to complain as well. Overall a very good and clean presentation.Now before I conclude, I rate the shows I watch MOSTLY by enjoyment. If a show is enjoyable, ill give it 8 and above, and thats probably why u might see that I have quite a high mean score for the animes Ive rated. As a 10/10 that Ive given, this is one of the shows that I think will undoubtedly be enjoyable for all, a very simple story, very likable characters and catchy OP/ED, all adds up to a great show overall. This is one of the shows that ill anticipate for every week, like how when youre 6 and eagerly waiting for the ice cream truck to come by every weekend. Even if rom-com isnt your taste, by all means give it a try, maybe youll poke into a region youve never experienced before too."
"Looking for a true romance, one with suspense, fluff, and drama? Then I will make this incredibly clear that this anime is not for you! I feel like I have to make this clear because I went into this anime based on description, genre, and rating expecting a romance and it really did not deliver.It has a lot of good qualities however. Anime and game lovers will find themselves identifying with the characters, and you’ll find yourself laughing at the exaggerated, but still relatable content. The art is also really cute, all the characters are distinct and different despite all being categorized as otaku’s....You get a peek into the lives of otaku’s of all different types, cosplay, crossplay, manga, videogames, anime, bl, etc. The main fandoms are all represented at least briefly. In its purest form, this anime is just about balancing otaku life with work life, that’s it.Still don’t believe me this isn’t a romance? Then I will spoil (but not really) the romance involved in this anime. For starters, the couple gets together by the end of episode one and it’s treated more like a joke. There is only one kiss scene the entire anime and all it is, is a peck (and it’s not even at the end of the series that this happens, so yea...no kiss at the end either) and again, it’s treated more like a joke. There’s really no development shown in the relationship, no misunderstands, or ups and downs. It’s more like two coworkers who share similar interests that happen to be a couple.I will confess that my score may be on the lower end than what this anime deserves. It’s actually a pretty good light-hearted, comedy. The art is cute, the characters are distinct and fun, and I admittedly got some laughs out of it, but I didn’t get what I wanted out of it and thus ended up rather disappointed."
"Part of becoming an adult is finding hobbies that enrich our life and fill the time after exhausting days at work. Wotaku centers around 4 main characters who are obssessed with hobbies society frowns upon, some of whom have little to no social skills at all. Momose, the main lead, is obssessed with manga, especially Yaoi, something she's had to hide from all her previous boyfriends and friends. The other 3 aren't much different: Hanako is also into yaoi and cosplay, her boyfriend Kabakura obssesses over yuri and gaming, and Nifuji games almost to the expense of all else. Momose and Nifuji are childhood friends,...and he comes to an idea: they won't have to hide they're both otakus if they date.The art and character models are stock standard for modern anime, and the soundtrack is sufficient but nothing special. There's promise in a story of adult couples who pursue their own hobbies, finding their own group that values what they do. Let's ignore Momose and Hanako's love of fetishized yaoi, or Kabukara's hyper-infantilized yuri, which is opening a can of worms. The major flaw is the characters are engaging as soggy noodles in a watered down broth. The female leads have their boy's love extend into their real life partners, getting excited by any close interactions between the two. They debate in a single scene which one is the top and which is the bottom. The character dynamics revolve around their eccentric hobbies, but we never get more than a superficial glance at those hobbies.But the biggest flaw is the characters seem to not care for each other. Nifuji and Momose's relationship never extends past childhood friends, even after they start dating. She's not particularly attracted to him, and he makes it clear he'd be into a girl with larger breasts. Their relationship and interactions barely progress or regress. It feels like one of convenience and never develops from that. We never really dive into their actual interests, besides passing references and some stock standard online gameplay.Hanako and Kabukara constantly fight when others are around, even if their interactions are much more lukewarm when they're alone together. Hanako's hobbies are probably the most engaging: she's a well-known cosplayer, and diving into the process she designs and creates the costumes could be an excellent story. At least they seem to care for each other, and spend some enjoyable moments together.The entire character dynamic is ""are the straights ok"" the anime. With a stronger cast, a deeper dive into their interests, or a stronger plot, Wotaku could be engaging with an adult cast so desperately needed in romance anime. Instead, we get something that anyone but a hardcore otaku could really enjoy. Wotaku pales in comparison to other stories revolving around otaku like ""Princess Jellyfish"". The dive into online gaming is superficial unlike ""Recovery of an MMO Junkie"". The obsession with yaoi never extends to what we see in ""Kiss Him, Not Me"". It's not particularly bad but it's uninspired at best."
"What makes a good romcom anime?CharactersComedyNarrativeRelationships...DramaRomanceTheses are the things that usually make a romcom anime better not always good though. In the Spring 18 anime season there were two romcom that were strangely competing with each other. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku. Both of these show uses all of these elements that I just listed to make theses respective shows better but yet only one of them was good though.3D Kanojo Real Girl is a badly written romcom where only it had characters would talk over with each other without letting the other person finish but at various times the show hardly feels like a romcom as the show feels like more like a shitty slice of life anime set in high school. Not to mention the portrayal of Otaku culture as well the characterization and relationships were handled very poorly to a point where point where you just want to headbang a table.Thankfully its competitor WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku did not suffer from any of the problems that caused 3D Kanojo Real Girl to become such a horrendous romcom anime and as a result WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku became the best romcom of 2018. Not the best anime of 2018 but still a pretty great one.So what made this romcom so great you may ask?You gonna to find out soon enough.Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku and with that said and done let's get started.Story.The story follows a female officer worker Narumi who secretly hides her Fujoshi lifestyle from her co-workers. One day at work she is reunited with her gaming geek childhood Hirotaka after discovering that they work at the same company. After some drinking sessions outside of work they start to date each other but will it end up being a perfect relationship for theses two or will they fall apart.I really liked the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.For starters the show does a great at establishing its characters right from the first episode.  Unlike 3D Kanojo Real Girl where that show establishes the two main characters in a contrived and silly way Wotakoi decides to establish its main cast in a more mature where in the very first scene of the show where Narumi begins chatting kindly to Hirotaka. Unlike 3D Kanojo where by now both leads would talk over each other and random crap we actually to hear Narumi inner thoughts were we find out this is all a front to keep her secret from being exposed. Hirotaka end ups only partially revealing her secret but it quickly hard cuts to them drinking together. Not only does the show do a great job at presenting its actions that they were both otaku's but it manages to respect the tone of the office setting. The thing that sold me in this show is how the how portrays its romance because you see in real life there’s always a time and place where you can date as the two love birds in the show actually don’t date with each other until a day of work is over. Meaning when Hirotaka and Naruni are not working they are dating.Like with any good romcom the show uses it comedy and romance elements right allowing us to really relate to every comedic and romance conversation that's goes along.The show also a great job at portraying the Otaku culture where it showcases the highs and lows being an Otaku as an adult age. Not to mention the show goes a great job with it's references to video games and anime like Monster Hunter, Mario Kart,  JoJo etcThe one thing that this show over most romcom that are coming out in recently is how the show doesn't take place at high school. Don't get me wrong I like my fair share of anime that were set in high school but in recent memory the high school setting itself was getting too abused to a point where some shows that would have been better if the shows were not in high school.  I know this doesn’t really make a romcom show but for this case it does because we get to see a romance that is in a more mature setting that it has its own rules to follow.Overall the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great.9/10Characters.The characters in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku pretty good for the most part.Our female romcom lead Narumi is a pretty good character. Despite trying to hide her Otaku interests from her workmates she’s actually a nice and passion girl who loves Otaku hobbies. However I have one sight problem with her and that she can a hypocritical at times where there was a piece of dialogue where Hirotaka asks Narumi why she hasn't tried dating someone who understands Otaku, she replies that only another Otaku would understand and Otaku are gross, so she won't do it. Am sorry but why would you deny a man who also an Otaku. If anything I thought date him because you both love the Otaku culture. Thankfully she becomes a better character later where she accepts dating with Hirotaka a man who is an Otaku but at there were times she can be bit cringe-worthy. Minus her slight cringly attitude at times I liked Narumi for the most part.Hirotaka is probably the best character in the series. Unlike Narumi he doesn’t even bother hiding that being a Otaku as he is seen doing Otaku things in the open and he’s not a shamed of it.The character chemistry for Narumi and Hirotaka is nothing but brilliant as they talk they time to understand each by doing all of these Otaku act’s outside of work life.Hanako and Tarou are two characters that I liked. Unlike Hirotaka and Narumi they relationship is a rocky one as they constantly like having a go with each other like enemies most of the time. While they are not as memorable as the main two couple I thought they were still enjoyable characters.Overall the characters were pretty good and enjoyable.8/10Visuals.For a romcom anime this shows looks great. A1 Pictures did a awesome at capturing the setting of the series with it's nice use of business colour pallets that blends in well the shows great character and appealing designs. This is by far the best looking anime I have seen from A1 Pictures and it's not even a shounen series while most of those shows would have decent to average visuals at best. Honestly if A1 Pictures had more anime in this style for they action series then those shows would have been least Bones/J.C Staff tier instead of looking at they just came out from McDonalds unfinished filled with art failures.The animation is pretty nice and smooth for what it is so that’s that.8/10Sound.The soundtrack in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great overall as it does a great at capturing the tone and setting of the series.Both the opening and ending themes of the show are very good and memorable.The voice acting is top notch overall. All the Seyiuss did a great job with the roles that were given.9/10Final Thoughts.Overall this show was just great romcom to start to finish.The story was great, the romance was excellent, and comedy was great and well executed. The characters are great where they all likeable in they own ways. The visuals were surprisingly great and appealing and the soundtrack was beautiful.Despite being only 11 episodes this show was still able to be a better and well thought out romcom anime then the likes of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san and 3D Kanojo Real Girl. It may not be my favourite romcom series ever but I was still one hell of a good one.If you’re looking for a great romcom anime that explores the Otaku culture in a realistic way that I recommend WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.Final Score 8.5/10"
"Wotakoi is a romance between young adults. Gamer guy who wears glasses and yaoi fangirl who acts like a tomboy. Apparently they aren't very confident about their own hobbies so naturally they go and announce their otaku lifestyle in a manner similar to ""yes, I am a vegan"" meme. Pretty cool.There are few things I quite like. Wotakoi has very direct dialogue, People say what they think and don't hide inside their shells. These characters are honest and don't spend 15 episodes pondering over how to convey. The comedy -especially after the first 2 episodes- is genius. The series is full of gamer memes...that feel very accurate to 90's kids (which our main characters also are). Episode 3 is a perfect example of rom-com done right.The main characters don't feel very special nor memorable. They are just normal, realistic folks who are doing the slice of life thingy. Arguably very smart choice when considering the nature of this series. Still, I found myself getting attached to them in just 2 episodes, and am already looking forward to seeing where their relationship will head. The actual romance between them is super cute and innocent. The overall execution makes Wotakoi seem like a feel-good series.At first, the side characters seem pretty dull, and come off quite comedic, but soon turns out they are pretty much the same as our main pair, just not in the lead role in this series. This is something to which I typically pay a lot attention, but this time our side characters are actually real characters and not filler people. I can appreciate that.The art and animation are rather typical. Nothing note-worthy in terms of good or bad. It has chosen the safe route, which is fine. The seiyuus consist of some big names, but none which voice I have yet grown tired of hearing, so I have no problems with that. When it comes to the OST, I have been too busy giggling at the cute romance scenes so I completely did not pay attention to any of the songs or if there even were any present. I only recall the video game BGM from episode 1. The series made a good job on making me forget that I was watching an anime. This is pretty much the perfect prove -for myself at least- that it is a decent show."
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (or simply Wotakoi), have two genres. Comedy and romance. That's it. Romcoms nowadays in the anime community has been popular in the late 2010's sparking a big genre called ''School''.Yet Im not talking about the ''School'' genre here. Im talking about how Wotakoi done an excellent job on progressing and making unique attempts on a Romantic-comedy segment that is surprisingly not taking place in a high school. Instead it follows the workplace of four unique characters. Unique as in every single one of this four have unique attributes that you can say ''How in the world does this four have...a partner with their attitudes?''.The story revolves mainly on the four characters of the show. Inspite of that, each episode offers uniqueness and heart-warming scenes that can make either audience feel comfortable or laugh at. It mainly focus on the lives of Nifuji Hirotaka (the quiet, not that sociable gamer), Momose Narumi (the cute, sparkling otaku and yaoi fan), Kabakura Tarou (the guy you always meet in the bar who looks like a thug but has a genuine heart) and Koyanagi Hanako (the cosplaying-loving woman and the only one who can stand-up against Kabakura.) Each episodes offers rare shots from a Rom-com like any other. Instead of doing classwork, they do office work. They are not students. They are adults. The fact that Wotakoi stands out this season is that its not like your typical high school drama like Tada-kun this season. It shows the picture of office workers and adulthood. The one thing that made this anime different to our ''in-real-life'' adulthood is that, Wotakoi still offers the taste of an otaku. Whether your a figurine collector, gamer, yaoi fan, manga fan or an anime fan, you can relate to either one or two or even every single character from these four and will make you laugh out loud. Its not only the environment is unique. The love story of this four as well. The fact that each character, have different taste, interest and attitude made them understand each other is truly inspiring. That is what you call friendship. Real friendship and that exist on the adulthood. I'm not against to the current status of Rom-coms on anime being on a high school environment. I mean some are good. Some are average. Although one thing is certain.. is that Wotakoi can upgrade the romantic-comedy segment into a whole new level.Every anime comes down into judging it by art, and Wotakoi, in all honesty, made it average on my opinion. Average although watchable. You don't need a very good animation for a romantic-comedy and all. This is not action. Although I would love to note that the animation used in the gaming episode and the opening is excellent.Speaking of the opening, this is one of those openings I added to my anime playlists because its just too good. Along with the animation and the dance (hands) choreography on the chorus of the opening, it is a great way to start off the episode. The ending as well. With its art picturing the characters like going home from a busy day of work to sleeping, with a cheerful singing, its just fit to the theme of Wotakoi.Overall, this anime when I first saw it on the PV or trailer, I was expecting it to be a good take for romance and comedy genre and I was not disappointed going through the 11 episodes. Wotakoi is good uptake of the genre and I rated it this high because of its story, mixing it with well-developed characters, fine animation, heart-warming openings and endings, and a good comedic material."
"I really don't understand how this anime gets this much praise, therefore i make it short and quick: One of the most boring animes i've ever watched and had to sit through (it was painful).>The idea had a lot of potential, but was very badly implemented.>The story and the characters are mega boring and the romance was non existent.>The art was pretty average and underwhelming.>The comedic approach wasn't well-conceived.I really wanted to like this anime, but was hugely disappointed. Can't recommend it at all...Save your precious time and don't watch it. How this anime could get a nearly 8 score is...beyond me."
"Wotaku ni koi muzukashii (or Wotakoi for short) is a really nice and cute anime.Now I have seen some comments saying that this anime has no plot and is just the daily lives of some otaku people. Have you not heard of Slice of Life? This is very much a slice of life, it has little to no plot but is just stuff that happens nearly on the daily. It is nice.The comedy also nicely hits, usually, if an anime is boring I find myself skipping a lot, but this anime I do not skip times so that is good.The story is about these...4 people, and they are otakus (nerds). One of them like Yaoi, one is a cosplayer, one loves video games, one loves collecting idols, etc. There are 2 couples in those people, and they are very open about their nerdiness in front of each other. It is very wholesome.This anime appeases the otaku fandom and romanticizes them in my opinion. Sure nothing wrong with loving a hobby, but being that engrossed in something to the point where it affects your relationship is wild and is romanticized here.The music is nice.OP is really really good, music is nice and all but OP animation is amazing.Animation quality is also really good. I liked it.Overall really nice show!8/10 still not really life-changing as I would give 9 or 10/10's. It is a nice comedic SoL anime.Thanks!-CyanCheetah"
"I have absolutely, ZERO clue how this has managed to pull a borderline 8 stars on MAL.  Just because the setting does not reside in a high school doesn't mean it is better than the ones that are.I want to write this quick review to make sure you don't waste your time with this one.The story is horrendously stale and the characters go nowhere. I'm not kidding when I say this and please take my word for it, I legitimately almost fell asleep like 3 or 4 times while watching this anime. That is how boring it was.Simply put, don't watch it....There are far better romance anime out there."
"This anime is simply put a fine piece of soul-soothing.This is no CGDCT and for that I'm honestly thankful, being able to create relatable situations and hilarious jokes and references to otaku culture.The emphasis it puts on corporal environment, the overall anxiety of fitting in and the enjoyment of our hobbies it's simply amazing and present in every episode so far without outshining the romance of our characters which I absolutely adore.Every character has their unique traits and the amazing choice of voice actors helps them in that regard giving that punchline neccesary to make the humor of the series get to you.It's a...great anime to watch when you arrive from work so give it try."
"I hate long reviews myself, so I'm gonna make it short. Full disclaimer, I dropped it after watching 6 episodes.MC - Main CharacterFMC - Female Main CharacterThis is not a romance anime even though it has the romance tag. The pathetic amount of romance it has is pretty one-sided and goes nowhere.Someone needs to tell these mangakas that there needs to be progress and not at a turtle speed. I mean, the premise was good, but I was expecting the main couple to start developing feelings for one another over time but that never happened.By the 6 episode, it was clear to me that the...MC liked the FMC but there was no sign of romantic interest from the FMC side. Hell, she treated other male characters better than she did the MC, and on top of that, it was pretty clear that the MC wasn't even her type, meaning she was not attracted to him, which is fine by me but ONLY if it slowly starts to change. Sadly, as I said, it did not.Overall: I was pretty disappointed because I did not get what I wanted from the show. One-sided love is not fun to watch especially if it does not develop into something more. A rom-com that has VERY little romance.Recommendation: Skip it. There are far better rom-coms out there such as Kamisama Hajimemashita."
"I'm wondering what's happening with slice of life shows lately.It's as if anime producers had a secret consensus, and on it they decided they'll sneak in non-existent plot into shows, and focus on making money with as little effort as possible. News flash: just because a show has slice of life genre in it, it doesn't allow it to be boring to the point of being a comatose-inducing drug.I can give you endless examples of other shows being super interesting regardless of main theme simply tracking a character or characters' lives or other barely existing plot examples. Wotakoi went off rails with plot less than...mid-way through, and decided to show filler episodes instead.Now, I haven't read the manga and perhaps it's different in it, but it doesn't excuse the poor, or rather, a complete lack of pacing and direction, resulting in my lack of engagement.Slightly annoying factor is that the shows such as this one somehow get a pass by an average person's critique and are now considered quality shows, when they are not. I get that by making the setting as uncomplicated as possible, you know, just a regular present day, no supernatural circumstances, or no deep psychological battle mysteries like known to all Death Note, no melodrama or different harem routes, none of that shit, it's guaranteed to avoid pretty much any illogical executions, events, inconsistencies or plot holes, like many action series suffer from for example, but there's no excuse for having a lack of guidance altogether and just call it quits.Atmosphere is lovely, characters are sympathetic, it's bundled in nice, shiny wrappings, the overall presentation is great, yet it ultimately fails to deliver any conclusion, it's too tedious and lacks life. I'm sorry but this will not go unnoticed by some people, myself included.I don't hate this show by a long shot, but I don't know how and/or why do these types of shows always leave a bad taste in my mouth."
"TL;DR It's a 7/10 show that is not meant for everyone. If romcoms are not your genre or want a romance that heavily focuses on development like Tsuki ga Kirei, then I wouldn't recommend it. The humor is good. The Opening is probably the best this season. However, I don't think the 3 episode rule applies here, if you don't like Romantic-Comedies.Wotakoi is a romantic-comedy that steps into the light of adulthood, and basks in the glory of being an Otaku? I'm just kidding. Being an otaku in society is still seen as a overall negative from all the weird things like Hentai and Cosplay...making people seem deranged for dressing as weird fantasy characters...BUT THAT'S GETTING OFF TOPIC. Anyways, Wotakoi is a light-hearted anime that really brings out what makes the romcom scene enjoyable. The character dynamics between all three of the couples: Narumi x Hirotaka ; Kabakura x Koyanagi ; Naoya x Kou, add a level of chemistry and flavor that never steps into disturbing or overbearing with its amount of fluff.Those who are expecting a fully-developed story with lots of romantic progression or character development are going to be sadly disappointed though. Neither of those elements get pushed forward. But, that isn't mean they aren't nurtured. Throughout the entire 11 episodes, the emotions and affection that we see nurtured throughout the entire series, while small, are noticeably different from episode 1 to the ending.Is this a show that everyone should watch? No. I don't think everyone is going to enjoy Wotakoi. It's an anime that feels like it was produced and developed for people like myself who grew up with Romantic-Comedies, and understand that speed is an aspect that rarely happens within these shows."
"Ok, so I tried so hard to like this show, I did. I fell in love with megane, (the show is so dreadful I only remember two people's names and they are side characters) at first but then he became so dull as a person, and not because of the cold-monotone personality they were trying to go for. He just was.Pink Hair chick, Momose (I had to open the info tab to get their names), is annoying, loud, and on more than one occasion admits she isn't attracted to her boyfriend. Now they go over this in the show where it could be a relationship...of convenience, (yes, yes it is), but it doesn't get resolved. These two have known each other since childhood, yet this moron doesn't know enough about him to be considered an acquaintance. I had to watch this more than once in case I missed things, sadly, I didn't.Now Gingertoki (Kabakura) and Green Haired chick (Hanako) are like the worst example of a couple. Now, everyone has arguments here and there, especially when both people are stubborn, but f***ing dammit. Him calling her a hag is not cute. Her forcing him to do things isn't cute. They get into a fight and it doesn't even get resolved and it pisses me off. It's unhealthy this type of arguing. They only gave them a couple of good eps and even then it didn't last. Like before it became 100% established that they were dating they were better with each other, then it's made clear and they're at each other's throats just for breathing weird. There is so much they have to work on for a couple that's been together for a decade.It was hard for me to believe that Hirotaka ever had a thing for this dumb chick since childhood. Like it all seemed forced.For all those people that loved it for not being the high school show where it takes ages for the couple to admit their feelings, you have been tricked with this show. These two dated because ""why not we're both otakus"" (worst reason), and throughout the show they couldn't admit their feelings. He didn't tell her how long he liked her for, she was still uncertain of the whole relationship the whole damn time, she was still not attracted to him until he removed his glasses and other chicks wanted him. Saying she hadn't seen him like that. Honestly, I can barely see them as friends. It's not that they're going slow, there is no fucking chemistry, hell there was more chemistry with Momose  (I did it, I remembered a name without having to look back) and Naoya. This whole show was Momose wondering if she loved Megane. They are literally acting like those kids that think they should date because they have things in common, but they really shouldn't because they just don't mesh well. So it is another high school show where the lead couple won't admit their feelings or act on them. It's just been dressed up differently.Now the one thing that wasn't resolved and I fear it will be for  season 2 that this show doesn't deserve, is the relationship with Naoya and Kou. Now those two were believable as a potential couple. It's like the writers spent more time making those two likable. Those seriously are the only ones I'm rooting for and even like. If there is a season 2, I won't watch it,  but at least resolve something.I give Garbagetaku a 2/10 only bc I love Naoya and Kou."
"Honestly, I'm sure If I should do a full review on this anime, just because it feels like there is more to come. It ended on such a weird note and it made you feel like there was another episode to watch after 11.However, considering that this was a fairly recent anime and the world as we all know is going through a pandemic, it can be fairly difficult to release more episodes since it takes a considerable amount of time to draw and animate adaptations from a manga.With that out of the way lemme break down why I have given ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard...for Otaku"" a 10/10.Story - 10/10Firstly, growing up from a kid to an adult can be scary and also exciting at the same time. We all have our own favorite hobbies, interests, or that dirty little secret that you just want to keep quiet about, and believe me I have few secrets which I would never share with anyone, no matter who they are.Nowadays, people don't like to admit it but it's part of our society and how we live in. This anime essentially touches on that topic, the English translation of the title is ""It's Difficult to Love an Otaku"" which if your living underneath a rock essentially means it's difficult to find love while you personally love all things anime and manga-related.Bring in characters that are exactly like that and work together in an office can bring an interesting storyline on what a possible scenario outcome would be. Welcome to a story of office romance, finding love, and a strong culture of otakus and gamers.Now, for those who watch anime and read manga on a daily basis, you can heavily relate to this show as it can be hard to find love or a potential relationship if someone like you watches this kind of thing. Opening up about this sort of topic can tell a lot about your personality and sharing it with friends can be a difficult experience too. You have no idea how your friend might react once they know you like watching anime and reading manga. Some people would take it and blow it out of proportion and make fun of you, call you names, and eventually that friendship would fizzle, it's the same sort of thing if you had a girlfriend/boyfriend, and during this anime one character by the name of Narumi, Momose had that exact same experience and her relationship with her boyfriend, it fizzled then died. She then, therefore, vowed to herself that she would keep her love for anime and manga a secret and would never share it with anyone unless they like the same thing.This anime's story was truly sweet, cute, funny, and quirky at the same time. The plot twists were fairly minimal and you can follow the story of a relationship-building between Hirotaka and Narumi.Art - 9/10As always, the art was truly well done. The design of the characters looked great, but I guess it took me a while to adjust to the eyes of certain characters, but only because most of the other anime's I have watched, the character's eyes were big and bold.I did however get used to it but anything slightly different than the eye design in this anime would kinda put me off.However, overall, the art and surroundings were superb and it really set the tone well.Sound - 9/10Fabulous, nothing else much to say. The opening was so catchy and so cheery it was perfect to hum along to when starting a new episode and that ending theme, my god, was utterly brilliant. I have even edited that soundtrack and turned it into a mobile phone/cell phone ringtone, it is that good. Of course, the soundtracks within the anime complemented all the scenes really well.Character - 10/10I think I've covered most of this section in the art and story sections but I guess I could say a few words here and try not to repeat myself. The character's in this anime were truly well portrayed and it made an all-around enjoyable experience to watch. The personality's of the characters were really interesting to learn about;:- a girl with an obsessed love interest for anime and manga.:- a boy who loves gaming and would not eat, drink or sleep during a vacation and just keep playing his games.:- a girl who loves cosplaying as a guy (very interesting indeed, I wonder how she hid those humungous hungolomghnonoloughongous) while she was cosplaying.and finally:- a guy who likes watching anime and reading mangaIt made the entire story and experience of this anime and really enjoyable one, I just wish there were more episodes, but I guess it's the waiting game now, hmmm.Overall - 10/10This anime was really good and I really enjoyed it, I would like to thank all my otaku friends for recommending me this anime, a solid choice and yes I would recommend this anime to all my friends who haven't seen it.Well, that pretty much sum's up my review for ""Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku"", if more episodes come out, I might add more but for now, time to watch another anime.Thank you very much for reading if you got this far, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.cryyptt_ <3"
"I'll preface this by saying that I have not read any of the manga for this series.You don't necessarily expect much to happen in a slice of life type show, but with Wotakoi, there is very little payoff. It all ends up feeling incredibly flat; each episode follows its own structure and there isn’t much of an overarching story being built. Everything is just enjoyable enough to keep you strung along hoping that something will eventually happen. And, it’s not to say that the characters don’t sometimes have their moments. There are cute interactions or jokes that land here and there, but the frequency...isn’t high enough to warrant a higher rating than a 5/10 for me.The romance is absolutely subdued here, and it doesn't really feel like much of a focus at all most of the time. Essentially, it just feels as though the show doesn't really know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a slice of life about 4 otaku nerds working in the same office? Or does the series want to try to explore a clumsy nerdy romance between two childhood friends? The show never seems to extend very far beyond: “These MCs are nerds! Wow aren’t they awkward and relatable? They’re so interested in vidya, manga and anime, perhaps like you, the viewer?”Ultimately, where this particular anime struggles is the character development. The characters are likable, but don't expect them to change much at all from the first episode to the last. Other romance anime do a better job of developing the relationship between the primary protagonists. However, this show really likes to emphasize that otaku lack social skills, which accomplishes about as much as you might think. This show truly is a slice of life at its core, and going in expecting more than that may leave you disappointed.A personal gripe for me was that a side character, Kou, is introduced far too late into the series. I really would have loved to see more of her, but there simply wasn’t enough time in an 11 episode timeframe. It was cute, and a romance could have easily bloomed there.All in all, this is a very average anime, propped up by largely forgettable, bland characters. But hey, the characters are nice to look at, and most of the voice acting is well done. At least it’s cute!Story - 3Art - 6Sound - 7Character - 4Enjoyment - 5Overall - 5"
"I decided to watch this anime after searching through the romance category of anime cause I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff and I'm glad I decided to watch this!Story: The story basically revolves around these two couples who all work in the same office who are all otakus (pretty much meaning nerds for anime, manga, games, cosplay, u name it) who all happen to be friends! Its a real slice of life anime that I enjoyed watching.  It was mellow, realistic, sweet and funny.Art: The art was decent! The designs of characters are important for me in a show and all of...the characters in this show looked good as did the places they went to.Sound: Nothing that really stood out or disappointed.Character:  All the characters were good! They all worked well off each other and i really didn't have a problem with anyone! Usually in a romance anime, there will be that one person you can't stand that tries to get in between a couple but I'm glad i didn't have to worry about that for this.  Everyone was chill.Enjoyment, Overall: I had a good time watching this show!  If anything, I wish there were more episodes so we could see the relationships progress more than it did but hey maybe there will be a season 2 or ova!  I highly recommend it to people who want to see a real chill, funny slice of life that is somewhat romantic that doesn't have pointless petty drama that doesn't make sense:)"
"*Disclaimer*Just personal scratch.Advised, possible spoilers.Opinion & InformalArt: 6/10 Pretty standard, but was cute and pretty I guess. Bright colors and clean.Animation: 6/10 Pretty simple. No action scenes and is pretty much a shoujo.Plot: 6/10 Just a SoL romance. The daily lives of the main couples....Development/Conclusion: 6/10 Open ended ending with some pretty good vibes. I like how the little brother has potential with the new girl they added. There were a couple cute scenes. A bit of character growth for the main dude. Not much development or backstory with the side couple. Sort of disappointing main couple development.Music: 7/10 Catchy and cute. No sound design to note. Bgm unnoticeable.Characters: 7/10 All the couples were cute. I liked their interactions. The main dude is sort of too bland for being a bland MC. I didn't particularly like any of the characters except for that new gamer girl they added in late. I just appreciated the cute couples.Overall: 6/10 It was fine but I wouldn't consider this a stand-out among Shoujo. This is a pretty flexible translation of the manga. I actually find this better than the manga."
"Wotakoi is light romantic comedy of responsible adults connected by the threads of their hobby--otaku culture. The cast are adults in the workplace that were able to come together because of their common interests: games, anime, manga, and cosplay. The series draws us to the feeling of making friends that we can share our interests (ones that we do not readily share to most our friends.)The animation is adequately pleasant. The opening theme is very catchy, it had me look up on sumika--and now they are a staple on my music playlist.The characters and their interactions are enjoyable. Particularly, Narumi and Hirotaka's relationship and...how they progressed is very cute. It is something we would ponder on--dating our best friend. Starting out as childhood friends, Narumi would find it difficult to have a partner that would accept her interests. Reluctant at first, Narumi and Hirotaka got together, although in a comedic take. We would see Narumi enjoy being able to freely express her hobbies. The interesting part is how they try to figure out how to act ""normal"" in a relationship, and I see that as something amazing to see that they do not have to force it and just be themselves.Overall, the series mixes comedy, romance, and drama very well--not too much, just enough."
"This anime is great for starters, not only the genre and itself is good, but the way it portrays the culture of japan in such a soothing way, it was fun to binge watch this anime.Every episode is fun and relatable, I was able to understand more what is an otaku,and specifically the way the characters interact, god my heart.This is one of the safe recommendation for starters.Although there are other series that can bring the same experience, the way this anime is just being itself is nice, this biased I know, but what harm could it bring?Also, the music, Bangers."
"Welcome to the latest ""what if a bunch of generic teenagers were adults"" anime. Let’s see what Japan has served up this time… Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku. Well, at least it has an interesting name, it’d be even more interesting if the show had stayed true to it for at least a single episode. It didn’t, and by the end of the first episode, the main characters are already dating.Okay, that one misgiving aside, Wotakoi is a decent workplace romantic comedy with plenty of good qualities but is ultimately weighed down by poor comedic timing. Let’s first discuss what the show does well...before diving into the issues.The characters are all fairly likable, while I never found any one of them to be great, their chemistry with one another is enjoyably infectious. With a premise like otakus falling in love, characterizing it’s cast in a believable and relatable way is where the show’s main success lies. For example, the lead character Narumi is a fujoshi and likely the most otaku of the four lead characters, yet she’s never made into a caricature. Cutesy mannerism and a little pigeon-toed running aside, her hobbies seem realistic and aren’t at the butt end of jokes. It’s the same with her co-worker Koyanagi, she’s a reasonably restrained fujo in public, but a well-known cosplayer at conventions. In the first few episodes, she and Narumi slowly learn about their hobbies because you can’t just dive headlong into the subject of BL with your co-workers unless you want to get a permanent side-eye from them. And Wotakoi handles this extremely well, otaku being sort of oddballs have to exercise self-restraint when talking about their hobbies. When they meet other otakus with similar tastes, it’s like they’ve finally found people who speak their own language.It's an ideal foundation for a rom-com about otakus dating, but the lead pairing Narumi and Hirotaka already have known each other for years before they start working together, so it feels like it's not such a struggle for them to be in love. Unless if you consider the 'love is hard' to be referring to the glacial progression of the romance then I suppose it's faithful to the title.About half of the show’s screen time is spent in the office space like a typical work comedy, and the other half is on dates and drinking parties just to keep it fresh, but it's a romcom so a threadbare story structure is inevitable. What's really important is the characters, not story, but that doesn't excuse Wotakoi's stagnant narrative, which we'll discuss more in depth after the positives.The show's cast being otakus makes them better, rather than being cringely portrayed like you may expect from its ilk, it's well done and relatable. The game otaku Hirotaka (and Narumi’s childhood friend) plays and references plenty of games without it feeling forced or tacked on. If the group is going to play Mario Kart, the scene isn’t about slamming the viewer over the head with Mario jokes, but the people playing the game. Good otaku representation is always ideal in a series like this because it helps the characters to feel relatable and fills in the gaps in their characterization. And that brings us to the issues. Aside from the characters being portrayed well for the archetypes that they fill, there is very little to them as people. It feels like they selected standard romcom archetypes, mixed them with otaku archetypes, then left the characters then forgot to add much depth leaving them as placeholders for actual people. We know the bare minimum about their personalities for them to function in a romcom. There the cutesy but occasionally oblivious Narumi, the stoic deadpan Hirotaka, as well as Koyonogi's air of confidence and cleverness, and the abrasive tsundere dude Kabakura.There’s not much great character development at all. When the show gets into backstories and motivates it only goes skin deep then backs off as if it’s afraid to tell us too much about the cast. Like the scene with Hirotaka telling Narumi about his ear piercing because the guy she was dating at the time had pierced ears as well. It was kindhearted and subtle flirting like Hirotaka tends to do throughout most of the series, with Narumi being typically oblivious or sometimes considering maybe she does love the guy she’s dating. Hirotaka and Narumi flirting is comparable to trying to carve an ice sculpture with a pencil, there’s barely any momentum and the characters hardly grow by the end. It doesn’t help that the show is still adding characters by the tenth episode to digress from the lead couple.The characters are still quite watchable despite these flaws because the show's writing doesn't travel far outside of its comfort zone to create a well-rounded experience. It's a series with no noticeably bad moments, just plenty of meh ones. Wotakoi is sadly an example of; succeeding only because it did not try hard enough to risk failure.From a technical perspective, the characters are at least well designed, passionately voiced, and their hobbies are realistically detailed, and they do have chemistry. Seeing arguments that Kyabakura and Koyanagi have over BL and yuri feels like they understand their own opinions greatly like the author was pulling from real people’s experience. If only the joke delivery capitalized on the chemistry’s potential, it could have been better. The romance between the two main characters is quite stagnant, but sadly the comedy is also affected by its own pacing problems. The pacing is slow and the jokes don’t hit with much impact. Looking at how the manga delivers jokes, it's much funnier and flows better. This adaptation just feels like a moving manga, there is no consideration for pacing or how it will animate. What likely caused this is a lacking budget and a director not talented enough to improve the source material in any way.For example; sometimes we’re slapped with an intentionally unfunny joke from the po-faced Hirotaka and they just hang on screen for a painful few seconds that feel more like an hour, grinding the scene’s pace to a halt. That’s the pace of a majority of the jokes, with very little animation aside from funny reaction faces (taken from the manga). Every joke is presented with a slow lethargic pace that makes the director seem like he has no concept of how to time a joke properly. That brings us to the show’s production issues. Ok, to be fair, the op is really well done. It’s dynamic, well edited, and offers plenty of details on the character’s personalities.The main cast having anime colored hair to help them stand out from the background is a bit jarring considering the blandness of their work environment. Speaking of which, often times it seems like the four leads are the only ones who work at the company. It’s partially excusable when they’re in a relatively small 6 cubicle office space. When wacky hijinks ensue and the four of them are running all throughout the building I can’t help but wonder if A-1 couldn’t spare the animation or if the writer couldn’t make the jokes funny enough without having to unrealistically remove all of the background characters. I suppose it’s better than the CGI crowds the show regularly uses. The end result is still somewhat funny if a bit unrealistic if only it didn’t bend the audience’s suspension of disbelief to get to the comedy. It’s scenes like this that make you wonder if the show would have been better if it were adapted by a different studio.Ah, if you noticed that I skipped over Kabakura when talking about what I liked about the characters, that was intentional. I think he’s a jerk who treats Hanako like an asshole then occasionally makes it up to her by doing one nice thing. The friction between him and Hanako actually gave the show a chance to explore that theme of love being hard for otaku, but instead, the conflict is reduced to: they’re together because they always have been. That itself is a message, that otaku don’t have many options, but it’s not a dynamic that you can just sweep under the rug. It should have been discussed because relationships like that do have negative effects on those involved, but like I mentioned there’s no discussion it’s just ""oh I’m sorry, have this gift and we’ll go back to normal"". They had some nicer scenes in the later half of the show, with them discussing yaoi versus yuri, and it’s genuinely nice. But it needed to be more than just moderately pleasant, there needed to be more substance or at least effective comedy.Having relatable and uplifting themes is great, but a show should still be compelling on its own and that’s where Wotakoi disappoints. The characters are likable for their strong personalities and in-depth hobbies, but they lack the development needed to be truly memorable. Even if the jokes weren't timed so poorly, this series is still lacking, but it sure could have helped if they hired a director with a better understanding of comedic timing."
"A workplace romance comedy about otaku's going into a relationship?..LA's in!To be absolutely honest, LA didn't think too much of Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii but after watching the anime, heck from the FIRST episode alone, the anime resonated with LA, both in it's romance and comedic elements but especially with it's characters of course.Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii a character-centric, but to be precise a relationship-centric anime and for it being a rom-com about otaku couples, this is a given. It follows Narumi Momose voiced by Arisa Date who has gotten a new job however she bumps into her childhood friend Hirotaka Nifuji voiced...by Kento Itou and blurts out that she's an otaku to her superiors, the thing is Narumi shifted jobs because of her obsession with anime and manga and being a fujoshi and kept it hidden to her normie boyfriends. Here's another thing, Hirotaka's and Narumi's superiors, well they are otaku's as well, Tarou Kabakura voiced by Di- Tomokazu Sugita, Hirotaka's superior and friend at work who is a huge manga fan, while Hanako Koyanagi voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro is Narumi's and a somewhat famous cosplayer and massive BL fan. Anyways with Narumi depressed that her secret's out, Hirotaka ventured that maybe he could be her boyfriend and support Narumi with her hobby and her in turn as well.And then and there, LA could already root for Hirotaka and Narumi's relationship with how many things they can relate with one another whilst having very different personalities, whilst Kabakura and Hanako's relationship is the polar opposite, yes they fight ALOT within the anime but them like Hirotaka and Narumi being childhood friends, their fighting subsides and they look at the bigger picture for both themselves as well as Hirotaka and Narumi and because of this, LA rooted for both of their relationships to work out and not many animes have LA rooting for BOTH beta and main couples but Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii did it!It's the character chemistry with Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii that just clicks with you and ALSO relatable at that. LA being very much similar to Hirotaka in a ways (but with anime instead of games) and LA's favorite character being Narumi so there was that, but seeing the four main characters just talking, having fun and helping each other with games, Comiket, watching anime, MMORPG's and with their love life out just made each of the core cast very solid, both individually and with their relationships as well, you know that they're friends and their actions bloody shows it and the factor of the entire otaku element is just icing in the cake for LA.With that, the comedy does have the typical character jabbing at times, but it also goes into anime references ALOT (especially with A1-Pictures previous works) as well as gaming and some of the comedy does involve observational jokes but they have all the great reaction timing and great voice acting that applies towards it that LA laughed ALOT in this anime and you know what LA says about comedies...it's all subjective, but the second one being if it'll make you laugh, it's done it's job.In terms of animation done by A1-Pictures, well LA has to give A1-Pictures props towards it's character designs, being distinguishable and distinct but even for such a minimalistic cast, A1-Pictures did great on the backgrounding work even if it's mainly work, Hirotaka's house and the gaming world but nonetheless, without needing the characters to say it you know what's what...even if the surtitles give it away anyways but semantics.For voice acting, well we have mostly veteran voice actors like Celt- Miyuki Sawashiro, Di- Tomokazu Sugita, Ere- Yuki Kaji as Hirotaka's younger brother and Hibi- Aoi Yuuki so typically it would be a great cast, but our two main couple of Hirotaka and Narumi are some fresh new voices, that of Kento Itou and Arisa Date, Kento Itou has been in iDOLM@STER SideM as Michio Hazama, but as Hirotaka he's does a great job in portraying the laid back, stoic gaming otaku even if he's pretty deadpan most of the time but nonetheless. The obvious standout the the best til last...goes to Arisa Date and LA actually knows of Arisa because she was casted in iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls (Huh, Arisa and Kento were both in iDOLM@STER spinoffs before doing this anime...coincidence?) as Emi Namba, the comedienne idol and now Arisa is flexing her chops as Narumi and LA just loved her acting throughout the anime, what's the best way of saying her vocal range was like, like a higher pitched (but controlled) and EVEN MORE HYPER Ayane Sakura and her overreactions were priceless to say the least, maybe some bias towards LA liking Narumi but still LA will MVP to Arisa Date nonetheless for her brilliant reactionary range, she was not only a perfect fit for Emi Namba but Narumi as well, hope she'll get more roles!*ahem* Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a brilliant down to earth, hilariously funny romcom about otaku's for otaku's like us with a solid cast and characters with some decent production value and a brilliant voice cast.Love doesn't seem hard for these otaku..LA is jealous."
"Once again, I found another reason why A-1 Pictures should focus on making romance comedy anime rather than action anime. One reason is with this anime, A-1 Pictures crews proofed themselves that they excel in writing short plots or building a character within those plots. Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii or Wotakoi, if you don't like to stumble your tongue, is an anime about love story and friendship between otakus in a working environment. The premise itself is very enough to drag me into watching this anime as I am an otaku who will enter the working society very soon.From many romance anime I have...ever watched, this anime maybe the closest one to reality as I really know that many people resent otaku for some unknown reason and dating another otaku maybe the only solution if you do not want to stay single. Enter the life of a fujoshi who just switched to a new job after her true nature as a fujoshi discovered by her ex-boyfriend who resent her for being one. She eventually surrounded by other otakus in her new job starting from her childhood friend game otaku, to a cross-dressing cosplayer otaku, and to an Evangelion loving otaku. What makes the story special to me is how we could relate to the situations happen in this anime making this anime so much immersive on its own especially if you are a hardcore otaku.I love how they depict each of their character as different kinds of otaku stereotypes. It gave us a more real perspective on otaku since nobody love everything. In the real anime community, we have different kinds of opinion and genre we love personally. Not rare that we fought each other just because our opinion over a genre or even over a best girl and I think that makes Wotakoi attached to me. This different spectrum in their characters makes us easier to relate and enjoy the plot even more.Of course, I really love how they slip otaku references here and there. Somehow reference jokes are always making me laugh and Wotakoi really did their job by making a good punchline for each of that reference joke. For you who really loves to pick many easter eggs along your way, this anime is perfect for you.Oh yeah! You definitely should check the opening song. I really love that opening song that being sung by sumika. It is catchy and really sticks to the romance comedy vibe that this anime offers to us.Overall, this anime really made me attached as I could relate to many things happened in this anime and every instances in this anime felt real and could happen anywhere and anytime in the real time. I would really like to see more of this potential as I hope they roll another season for this anime."
"Wotakoi is probably one of the best rom comedy that I watched. It has a simple plot but is well done. Instead of the typical high school romance setting, this is set in a typical Japan office workplace with otaku adults. It mainly focuses on two couples and what they do after work. The main couple is Narumi, a closet otaku and then Hirotaka, a big gamer who doesn't really try to hide that fact. The other couple is Koyanagi and Kabakura, and they are sport otaku who tend to argue a lot. I love the scenes where they game, go out to drink, and...just share their bond for anime/manga. This makes it more relatable for me at least. The show touches up on the struggles in their relationships but has a lot of cute moments as well as the characters try to change and improve their relationship. There's not much drama and the comedy blends in really nice! It's so cute too and I love the game references. (ex. mario kart!!) There's nothing unique about the show, but the fact that it's so relatable makes it so much fun to watch. Who doesn't play games after work or watch anime?!OP and ED are very good and I can't stop listening to the ED. This show was probably my favorite this season excluding the long shonen anime."
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii: The King of Rom Com anime has arrivedHonestly, I think the only thing I could criticize about Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is that it had only 11 episodes. What a great series!In my first impressions I already said that this series could be the revelation of the season; however, I must say that I was wrong. Why? Because I was too short. This series came to fight the top in the top of best romantic comedy anime.When a series has good characters, is daring to establish the plot, manages to create great and fun scripts from the setting, is...able to develop its characters without having a defined core plot, shows the couple's relationship realistically, has a very good soundtrack; and has a direction that manages to blend all of the above in a brilliant way, how will not you fight for the top?And I am leaving out many other points in favor of Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii, or Wotakoi as it is known in the community. I could have added that the series has lots of references to other works or products of anime, manga, cinema, theater and even advertisements; or that this anime did not hesitate to start from the get-go with its two main couples already established.In fact, to further subvert that legendary cliché that the leading couple must be established in the epilogue; the setting established that Hanako and Tarou had been dating together for years before the beginning of the series. What happens is that it was overshadowed by the fact that Narumi and Hirotaka started dating right at the end of the first episode.Of course, here it is necessary to point out that all this argument comes from the original material. The manga created by Fujita already has the couples perfectly built, so the great merit of Yoshimasa Hiraike in directing the anime and writing the scripts was to achieve an excellent adaptation.From there, those who saw this series witnessed a masterful development that included several key aspects: 1) A humor that feels fresh and natural. Gone are those formulas of forced scenes, of sexual jokes for elementary school children, of exploitation of the child from the beginning or of the genre of the false Japanese harem.And many could say that this was because the protagonists were adults; However, in others they also have adult protagonists and yet the creators make them behave worse than a teenager. In fact, in many series (including several), one of the main criticisms is that it seems that the fact that the protagonist is an adult is something nominal because you never see it in his behavior.2) An exploitation without fear of the fact that the two couples were counted since the go. Within the few series that established the protagonists as a couple from the beginning or in the first exchange, not all the others are done afterwards and that is something that often ends up weighing.In some cases, the establishment itself is a liar because the classics are the parameters where a girl who looks promising for the protagonist arrives, but in reality there is nothing between them; in others, it is true that the couple establishes themselves, but then they delay it to show us basic things such as a date, a handshake and a kiss story.Fortunately, in Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii they had no qualms about showing us Narumi and Hirotaka, learning to be a couple at a logical and credible rhythm. Gentlemen, this is very important. If already with adolescents it is totally unreal to see them spend tons of episodes so they have the courage to hold hands; with adults that results in an abomination.It was wonderful to see both Momose and Nifuji grow as a couple through experiences, thanks to the support of their friends and especially to decisions taken as a result of maturity according to their age.On the other hand, the couple of Hanako and Tarou presented to the audience a very little-seen dynamic within the anime. Let's do a mental exercise, how many protagonic couples do you remember that for the beginning of the series they have been dating for years? And I do not mean those couples who live apart despite having years together. What's more, how many couples in the anime do you know that they have years together at the beginning of the series?At the most, you can tell me the parents of the protagonists or some adult couple over there; however, these couples mostly do not have any relevance except to be plot points at some moment (sometimes, not even that). Therefore, the case of Hanako and Tarou is almost unprecedented not only in romantic comedy but in anime in general.Obviously, that generated a lot of expectation because developing both characters was a challenge; however, after seeing the series it was clear that the execution was simply fantastic. Seeing Koyanagi and Kabakura it was easy to identify them with our own experiences or with those of people in our environment (whether otaku or not)And this is the great secret of this series. Its naturalness and realism in developing the plot and the characters generated that the audience could identify fully with everything that happened. Much more, when the otaku world was a main part of the setting.I do not want to reveal anything of the plot because those who have not seen this series deserve to be able to enjoy it without spoilers; But I will say that each of the situations shown was hilarious, very creative and extremely realistic.Finally, the references seen in the series were all great. First, because of the enormous quantity, but second, and more importantly, because of the creativity in making them. In addition, this posed an additional challenge for the audience because it was very difficult to identify them all.Is that within the opening itself is a great reference to musically, and that was already a statement of intent. Card Captor Sakura, Castlevania, Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, Evangelion, Mahou Tsukai no Yome, Asahi Super Dry beer, Mario Kart, Donkey Kong Country and Jo Jo, were just some of the works and / or products referenced in the anime. Even the acclaimed Japanese female theater company, Takarazuka Revue, was mentioned.Regarding the technical section, the animation was competent with pointed peaks and valleys, the design of characters was attractive within the generic; and the management did a great job adapting the original work.Regarding the soundtrack, it was interesting that they looked for themes that would remind us of video games because that complemented very well with the visual resources used; In addition, the opening ""Fiction"" interpreted by Sumika was a fun theme that brilliantly managed to get us into the environment to enjoy the series.In short, a great anime that did virtually everything right and whose only palpable flaw was to have only 11 episodes (although despite this it managed to cover almost everything that has been published in the manga). It was amazing how quickly it made its way and hopefully we can have a second season soon. Definitely, ""The King left the building"".SUMMARYWotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii came to show how to make a good romantic comedy anime without having to resort to the already insufferable formulas of the genre. 9.5/10."
"Wotakoi asks its audience a question: ""Can you be an otaku and an adult at the same time?"" By the end of the series, the answer would be: ""Yes, with a little help from some friends"".The narrative starts with Momose Narumi as she hits the ground running for her first day at work. The reason? Her co-worker (and her ex) at her previous office discovered her true color as an otaku and the color spread like an unwanted seasonal stomach flu. Lucky for the misunderstood young woman, she would discover a brand new love (an otaku himself) and several new friends (more otaku) in her...brand new world. Nonetheless, it doesn't mean everyone can all go sleep soundly at night. Nope, they cannot. They have manga/game to catch up on till midnight and till kingdom come.Wotakoi would definitely serve as a catharsis for closeted otaku out there. Every character is relatable, every struggle is familiar, and every touching moment is well-deserved. Unfortunately, the art just cannot keep up with the emotional resonance of the anime. In fact, let me put out this question into our world as well: Why when it comes to comedy-oriented anime, the art tends to be under-cooked? The genre always has a chip on its shoulder, perhaps, but shouldn't the industry realize by now that its dominance is no small feat compared to the literal beauties such as Persona 4 or even KimiUso?A-1 Pictures, you know you're better than this. Come on.#felixlovesanime"
"A very good show for people who like romance anime, but with adult characters in a work place setting. The show is very relatable for adults in similar cirumstances. Unique story and the animation is quite good. The characters stand out as being unique. The show is realistic showing the mundane aspects of work life. I think others will like this show. It's a breath of fresh air to have a rom com anime not in a school setting as that has been done many times before. I recommend others to watch this show. It is appropriate for most ages."
"Wotakoi. It hits differently. A softcore romantic realistic side portrayed through beautiful animation and its well crafted. If someone got a hard relationship and got heartbroken or something, they can literally tune in to the anime and it would make them smile.Mainly the plot is slow-paced and very small character development throughout the whole story. A slice of life. The fact I love about this anime is it's soo much light-hearted and really very cute. I can say it feels like the adult version of Horimiya at some point.I basically enjoyed it because I watched it after the STEINS GATE series, and you know...the pain right? I just can't think about anything but Makise Kurisu for a day. Then I started watching the first episode and ended up completing it without pausing. It felt warm.I enjoyed it as a Single weeb and I think you should end up loving it for the simplicity.El Psy Congroo..."
"This romcom is one of the most unique plot i have ever seen in a anime. While in most cases you have a pritty standard story where there is a person trying to gain the affection of another person and the hurtles they need to overcome. This anime takes that standard plot line and throw it out the door for thier own unique approach on the topic. Because of that you have a really amazing romantic anime that is like no other!I highly recommend this anime, it was really well done and I have no complaints about how this was executed! The characters are super...interesting and the story keeps you entertained and caring for each of the characters. My only issue is I wish they had more EP and we could have seen them grow even more!"
"There is not enough anime on the adulting life. This is a wholesome and simple yet slightly realistic take on romance. Specifically for anyone in their mid to late 20s or early 30s, this is great for those in the grind of daily office life. No crazy cringe over the top drama or absurd mis-understandings. Just simplicity. It's so simple that is mirrors the day to day interactions of life. Some people want to escape reality and want over the top drama that doesn't remind them of the real life day to day. There's enough escapist anime. This show is a bit more tame and...again, super relatable to anyone working office jobs. Highly recommend, wish there were more."
"Boring and forgettable.I started watching in and watched to episode 9 to figure out I have already watched it like 5 years ago but totally forgot everything because it was boring.In this rom-com we see neither romance nor comedy.All jokes are around either nerds being awkward in normal life, nerds being awkward with other nerds when they need to do something normal and fights between the other couple.In first episode they decide to ""date"" and they occasionally hang out together like friends, playing games and going to drinks or anime cons together.On the stretch of 10 episodes absolutely nothing happens on romance front.They kinda...start to respect each other more. And this is the main point of all of this.Sit-com part is forced. I literally laughed once in 11 episodes.A bit of life the story gets with the tertiary character getting into relationship with another tertiary character not knowing that this is a girl. But nothing happens yet.In last episode the heroine cooks something in the apartment of the main hero for the first time. Before that she did not even know he has empty fridge 100% of the time.This. Is. Basically. It."
"I'm pretty sure the majority of the hype for this anime is solely from the dance sequence in the OP. The synopsis says that the main couple starts dating because the guy offers, and Naru takes the deal. I understand that originally, she had no intention of dating him, but she does, and they are suppose to explore their awkward relationship, but there is BARELY any progress made. I am currently on episode 8 (?) of this show. When they have been dating for 7 episodes and 4 or 5 months in the universe, why is the girl still debating if she likes the guy?...It's so strange how she's still like ""He's not my type at all, but you know I had to compromise LOL."" after so many months? I don't know if there will be more development in the last 3 episodes but if there is, then the pacing would be HORRIBLE. Honestly, I'm watching out of the hope that it does end up that they have at least one scene where they are like ""I am so glad we are dating."" I also think it is strange how the main girls objectify their partners so much. ""It's otaku culture!"" No, it's just weird. And while I enjoy the secondary romance WAY more than the main one, I can't help but say that their banter is repetitive and annoying."
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Love is Hard for Otaku)Otaku being the equivalent of a gamer/anime lover.This anime delivers a pleasantly, comical experience through the intense emotions of the characters. This story is based upon Otaku gaining love, and holds true to the end of the story. That is the whole purpose of this story, and the characters achieve that through finding other Otaku to interact with, in this case being in the workplace. The characters kind of stumble upon each other and through a series of bold moves interact with each other for what would be described as an incredible experience.I guess life is...more fun when we gather the courage to do something crazy, eh?Four main characters are the bases of character development with a fifth/sixth joining temporarily along the way. Each character is given a distinct personality and have many flaws because of it. This is exciting, as we are all humans, and as well it's great to see the strengths of our characters in situations such as pissing off another character and then trying to make it up to them. Totally normal situation, ya?In fact, this whole anime is full of normal experiences and it's hilarious to see them back in action. We ourselves have probably been in many of these awkward situations or would like to be... how do I feel? How do they feel? What should we do next? Alright. Here I go! (being in the mindset of a guy interacting with a girl).Alright, ratings time:Story - 8 - In terms of a slice of life, this anime does a good job of building up the experience for the viewer and the main characters along the way. There is story progression.Graphics - 9 - Very modern and well done. There are even times when they incorporate an additional graphics engine to render games that they play within the anime itself. Super cool.Soundtrack - 8 - Nice to listen to. Fits the mood well.Characters personas - 8 - I felt that the characters expressed themselves very well and showed fault and strengths, and were consistent with their nature.Voice acting - 10 - Absolutely awesome Japanese voice acting. Really spot on and my favorite thing about this anime, if that can be said for voice acting.Overall - 8 - Lovely experience, that.Recommended - Yes, for all Otaku out there looking for love, or for ones with girlfriends now or more (you make me proud), and the two of you need something to watch together."
"Wotakoi exudes the refreshing confidence of a story that deals with working adults rather than high schoolers.  When dealing with amatory matters, Wotakoi is a damn sight more graceful and insightful than anime treatments of romance tend to be, the result of following characters with greater maturity, perspective, and experience than the standard oblivious teenagers.  Nonetheless, while it establishes its central relationships with frank efficiency, the show doesn’t always convey the depth and warmth in those relationships that would make the statement in the title resonate.  Love is hard for Love is Hard for Otaku.With the youngest of the four protagonists...being Narumi and Hirotaka at 26, Wotakoi’s quartet is comfortably lodged in adulthood already.  These characters are settled into their hobbies and are well-invested in them; Koyanagi has an established reputation as a cosplayer, and Narumi enjoys some success as a doujinshi creator.  They have inveterate tastes that they exhibit with the ease of people who have been otaku for the better part of two decades instead of just a couple of years, with Narumi functioning as the fujoshi, Hirotaka the gamer, Koyanagi the cosplayer, and Kabakura the guy who is deluded into thinking that he is comparatively normal but still loves Yuru Yuri at the age of 28.  They all have regular office jobs (the same one, apparently) and can financially support themselves and their extracurricular activities.  The lack of classrooms and uniforms and homework is, if only replaced by offices and business attire and overtime, a breath of fresh air.Koyanagi has a self-possessed coolness that frequently rings hollow in younger characters, Kabakura’s seniority grants him some measure of actual authority, and Narumi’s infectious fangirl passions can drive her into 18+ territory without, as we might find in high school anime, vague suspicions that this might be inappropriate content for the characters.  Even Hirotaka, a familiarly nondescript and inexpressive character, comes off as a purposeful recluse who does take note of himself and his environment to a greater degree than we might think, whereas a traditional high school context might have made him more of a caricature.  No one is safe from miscommunication, self-deception, oblivious behavior, and petty disputes, but Wotakoi’s characters can handle themselves and their issues more adroitly than the usual cast of inexperienced adolescents.In addition to the “adult” side of its characters, Wotakoi grasps the “otaku” side with understanding and aplomb usually absent from attempts to capture the quirks and feelings of a particular subculture in media (even if it’s that medium’s own subculture, there’s no guarantee of success).  The games that Narumi has to play to sniff out fellow otaku at work, Kabakura’s stubbornness in maintaining his preferential integrity, Hirotaka’s uncharacteristically playful text-speak with Narumi, the jarring gravity well of encountering a regular person after too much time in the esoteric hobbyist sun, and the freeing therapy of having friends around whom you can express your true self are all true-to-life by my reckoning, and the numerous scenarios pulled from everyday life as a nerd, as well as references to properties like Evangelion and Cardcaptor Sakura, demonstrate some firsthand knowledge and love on the part of the creator(s).  With each of the four leads representing a different subsubculture, as mentioned above, Wotakoi has plenty of opportunities to explore the habits and proclivities of its audience.Where Wotakoi falters is in its amorous aspects.  It’s true that Hirotaka and Narumi have excellent chemistry: they open up to each other right away and from then on become an inseparable and complementary duo.  Likewise, though Koyanagi and Kabakura launch into shouting matches at the drop of a hat, their underlying affection never evaporates.  What we don’t see are the big questions, the real fights, and the serious romance, which are only hinted at or glossed over in the show and need some presence if Wotakoi wants to distinguish itself as “Love is Hard for Otaku” instead of “Friendship is Easy for Otaku.”  The title of episode two asks, “Are We Now Dating?”, and that’s a question whose circumspect response only approaches closure at the end of the series.  In a pair of pairings that seem to have formed out of convenience – convenience for the characters, not for the story, which is a good thing – questions arise regarding the exact nature and future of these relationships.Love really IS hard for otaku: in the case of Koyanagi and Kabakura, each party has made compromises to maintain a relationship with someone who can put up with their hobbies, and in the case of Narumi and Hirotaka, the two seem to hang out because they support each other’s pursuits and can facilitate the other’s professional success, as if it were an expedient business practice (Hirotaka’s first-episode “confession” was certainly more of a business proposal than anything else).  Being part of such an active, obsessive subculture can make relating to outsiders difficult, or at least tiresome, so it’s not unrealistic that people would gravitate towards each other based on these superficial similarities.  Those connections make for great friendships, though not necessarily lasting relationships.  I wish that the characters displayed a bit more interest in each other as partners rather than pals.Koyanagi and Kabakura, a veteran couple whom we know have been dating for about a decade now, don’t have much problem being affectionate with each other, relatively speaking; we see Koyanagi stealing kisses, Kabakura making clumsy but well-meaning gestures, and the two of them spending a lot of time together in the quiet manner attributable to couples who feel at home simply doing nothing in the same place.  They’re clearly comfortable enough to trade vitriol when they’ve wheedled or casually insulted each other too much (with Koyanagi cutely shouting “BAKAKURA!”), and they know where to hit to make it hurt and how to placate the other side when it’s all over.  But the show passes up many opportunities to look beyond the surface level and explore what makes this a fundamentally stable, loving partnership.In episode 4, a distraught Koyanagi tearfully demands to know if Kabakura has “settled” for her; knowing that she isn't his “type,” she harbors doubts about whether their relationship has any firm foundation.  Showing her in such an uncharacteristically vulnerable state, Wotakoi proves itself willing to ditch its often contented perspective to dig into some problems unique to the premise.  Yet as Koyanagi breaks down, venting these insecurities that have apparently plagued her for a long time, Kabakura keeps his lips sealed.  He gently chastises her for causing a scene, essentially dismissing her frustrations as drunk talk – not that he’s mean to her, because he is clearly sympathetic, but he totally whiffs on demonstrating his love for his long-term girlfriend.  We don’t get the heart-to-heart where they express how they actually FEEL about each other.  We don’t see them acknowledge that they’re together because of mutual love, not just mutual pastimes.  Maybe the two of them have been through this before, but the audience hasn’t.  To let Koyanagi’s entreaties go unanswered is to leave us wondering if she has stumbled upon an unfortunate truth that sours the tone of the show.Narumi and Hirotaka have a different sort of relationship: one that leans toward platonic companionship.  We almost never see the two of them in any kind of romantic context; they’re always joined by Koyanagi and Kabakura, or they’re playing video games like they did as kids, or they’re sabotaging through their own awkwardness the rare personal moments they do find.  The shared interest in otaku culture, even broadly, is a big part of their chemistry – Narumi and Hirotaka can be themselves while they’re around each other, they understand each other’s peculiarities, and they can support each other’s dungeon crawling and Comiket preparations – and these things are very important, but where does the “love” in “Love is Hard for Otaku” come in?  Narumi might get jealous of Hirotaka’s popularity or flustered by his occasional forwardness, but such scenes feel like obligatory reactions, not reflective of Narumi personally; she did walk into this relationship unexpectedly, it’s true, so this might be a lot to ask, but I had hoped that an anime about adults would be a little less anime about everything.Hirotaka has been crushing on Narumi for years, as a few melancholy flashbacks establish, so his feelings are reasonably clear.  Narumi has a few affectionately shaded moments, but little to suggest that she returns Hirotaka’s feelings.  It feels like the two of them are masquerading as boyfriend and girlfriend because they each need someone to fill that role and they get along well, rather than because they’ve found legitimate life partners in each other.  Sure, that’s how some relationships are in real life, and that’s really how the first episode presents it, and it’s not as though a close friendship itself is insignificant – but I don’t want to watch a romantic comedy about people who will hang out for a while because they’re good company and go their separate ways once the fun has been had.  I want to see Hirotaka de-unrequite his love.  Narumi has found someone who accepts her for who she truly is, and now I want to see something greater come from that.  If we’re meant to believe that, however hard it may be, love – not brotherhood – between otaku is ultimately sustainable, I want to see evidence of a future in this relationship.  I want to hear one character say the words “I love you” to another.  I don’t think that’s too much to ask.  Hirotaka is 26 and he can’t hold his girlfriend’s hand.  Maybe this is set in high school after all.Still, Wotakoi does throw us a bone now and then.  The characters go on dates, they buy each other gifts, they spend quality time together, they acknowledge each other as girlfriend and boyfriend...  I wish that things could be clearer and more satisfying, but as I opened this review by saying, this show still has a serious leg up on most of its competition.  Overall, I’m thrilled with the easy companionship these characters have with each other and the fun that they share.Visually, Wotakoi has middling production values: generally good, with nothing that stands out as being egregiously under-animated; the episodes vary in quality and some scenes are just a little off-model or bare-bones.  Nothing matches the OP in terms of quality, though it is an unusually great OP, with some very fluid (and infectiously adorable) dance routines from the starring couples set to a cool, catchy, relaxing tune that matches the tone of the show.  The color scheme of pink, blue, green, and orange is a little weird at first, but it works well for the characters.In a cast that includes Miyuki Sawashiro, Tomokazu Sugita, and Yuuki Kaji, it’s Arisa Date who steals the spotlight as Narumi.  Her eccentric, spirited delivery spans all the rapid tonal shifts and quirky affectations that would be characteristic of an energetic girl like Narumi, especially when gushing about her passions to her close friends.  Taking a very close second is Aoi Yuuki, whose clipped, husky reading of Kou’s lines makes for the most painfully accurate expression of social anxiety I’ve seen this side of WataMote.  Kou is hands-down my favorite character and it is a true shame that she only gets introduced in the second-to-last episode.  I am ready for my three-cour spin-off anime about Kou’s daily life.  I want to see a Kou-On! that’s just about Kou sitting around, playing video games, and drinking tea.Overall, Wotakoi is a great series, and in spite of a few unengaging story lines, some potential for better production, and how long I’ve spent bemoaning what I perceive to be its shortcomings, it offers an all-too-rare alternative to the billions of cookie-cutter high school romance anime that for all intents and purposes characterize the medium of anime in its present form better than almost anything else."
"The amount of talk between the two girls about BL greatly hurts my Yuri heart.The comedy is nice with characters that match well with them.The only character I at times didn't like was the younger brother of the male lead. He did get better later on though.I surprisingly didn't think the two guys in this wasn't bad. I thought that they both fit their girlfriend's personality and didn't seem forced.The animation tends to be nice without looking generic.I do think that it got kind of absurd how much they'd talk about BL. I'm assuming they're made up for the sake of the...show. But I did actually see a bunch of Yuri novels that looked real and good. I'd actually want to read them if they were real.I do like how the younger brother is hinted at getting a girlfriend in the future.Honestly, I think the romance between the Younger brother and the girl would be nice. I'd love seeing the girl start paying more attention to her looks as the two of them get together.Overall this is a fun show and I'd say is either my favorite or 2nd favorite right after ""Comic Girls"""
"I feel a little let down. Don't get me wrong, there was not a fault in the entire show... but it didn't do anything either. There was no progression!It's great that one character wants to be seen ""as a man"", but it's forgotten about.It's great that one character has insecurity about her body, but it's forgotten about.The show explores their relationship, but asides like, a single hand hold, even that is forgotten about!The fault may lie in the characters. Their relationships to one another are astounding in the way they are written, but each of the central cast is one-dimensional on their own....Case-in-point, there was a pre-opening-credits scene with the male-lead, exploring his morning. He got up. He played his game. He went to work. That was it. No, seriously, that was it.If you're looking for an anime about adults (not high schoolers), about game-otaku, and about a relationship with complexity, might I recommend 'Recovery of an MMO Junkie / Net-juu no Susume'... despite the controversy surrounding the director of that anime, it is far more worthy of your time."
"Wotaku no Koi wa Muzukashii is a rom-com anime that all otakus can relate to. It is an anime adaptation of a manga of the same name. This review contains as little spoilers as it can,Story: 7/10Wotaku dosen't really have a deep story line (just ike every other rom-com) however it handles the theme really well. The story is properly paced and very much relatable to any adult otaku who tries his best to fit in with the society and his struggle to find other otakus who share the same tastes as him. The story however dosen't dig deep into the romance as much as...it should. Questions are raised on why otakus tend to date other otakus and I would like more such questions to be raised.The story has followed the manga without deviating till now.Art: 7/10Wotaku dosen't have any better art than the story needs. The art is pretty neat but could be better. Considering the art budget of a not very demanding series such as this, the art gets a 7.Sound: 7/10The music used in this series is mild just like it should be. The OST is good but would have played out better if it was a bit more catchy.Character: 9/10What I love about Wotaku are its characters. In a series such as this one, characters probably play the most important role. The manga has done a pretty good job on the characters which has been properly followed in the anime. The development of characters is a bit shallow but you can't really complain much about that in a comedy oriented rom-com.Enjoyment: 10/10I can't guarantee anyone reading this review the same 10/10 in this category. I have given a solid 10 here just because of the season in which it aired. In a season that contains some of the most anticipated series, Wotaku serves as relief from all the other heated story lines. Though there are two other series of the same caliber: Hinamatsuri and Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai, in my opinion Wotaku does it best. The series has me waiting for an episode every week.Wotaku is certainly the best rom-com this season and probably one my all time favourites. I rate this anime 8 out of 10 overall.Note:This is my first detailed review on MAL. Suggestions are welcome!"
"It's okay.The timing on the jokes are a little off, feels like they couldn't quite translate the punchiness of the manga joke into the anime format. Definitely a romance before a comedy, and if you can't buy into the slightly over dramatic romance moments where the comedy takes a backseat, no amount of 'pretty okay' otaku jokes will drag you back in.The art is nice when it's nice, but definitely has 'don't look too closely when it's showing a far away shot' syndrome. All the characters are pretty good, would husbando Hirotaka. Really lacks any ending, which I suppose should be expected from an...ongoing somewhat romance comedy anime with little to no arcs (from what I remember of the manga). Honestly feels like it had LESS of an ending than other romance shows I've watched.But you're here for the atmosphere, it's comfy and I thought it was slow moving comedy romance. I like to make fun of video game Let's Plays for being 'friendship simulator' but this is like a otaku friendship simulator anime.Not fantastic, but definitely okay."
"to anyone who doesn't think that this is romantic enough or realistic and that it's just 'teenagers but aged up' i got some news to tell uas an adult in a relationship with friends in other adult relationships this is show completely accurate. i was so moved by rage by negative reviews that i felt compelled to write a review.wotakoi manages to portray casual intimacy so accurately and it has pop culture references that an adult in their 20s now would absolutely have.maybe it's not fantastically romantic enough and there isn't any dramatic shit but honestly this is the closest thing to real...life accuracy i've seen depicted in anime. the internal monologues r stuff that i've had (and my friends have had) before -- stuff like wondering whether your partner still loves you in this very moment.it doesn't seem BIG, but to you it is. that's why i love wotakoi. it manages to portray the mundane activities in life accurately.it's not perfect by any means (god knows the animation is janky sometimes) but it has my whole heart AAA go watch it lads"
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a must watch anime for us who enjoy and know much about anime and Japanese pop culture.I always expect much from anime with working adult theme. Because well, we can say that one adult know much more than other adult. I'm sorry if what I'm saying is not clear.What I want to declare here is, maybe some of you feel it too maybe some not, but what i feel towards theme like this, its always has a different view than common anime. Well, maybe I'm too exaggerating, but for me, it is always anime like this that makes...me confuse when will I watching it. Anime like this is like gambling, sometimes it is really good, and sometimes not really that good.In this case wotaku has give me a really really good enjoyment from such theme. Because in this anime, the writer not only gives the enjoyment, and the feeling, towards the character of the story, but to us too, the watcher.What can beat such a relatable moment when watching anime that maybe we know about, we like about, and we favorite about?This anime has a really balance story progression, character development, and good romance which makes us wanna cuddle with our partner. The story is told with no rush, but with slow progression that makes the show feels has a fast paced story, but it is not. The character is told balancely alongside the story which makes the show even awesome. And the reference that makes us the watcher feels so relatable with the character of the story is what makes this anime even outstanding.But even every good story has a flaw. And the flaw in this anime is, it has an ending."
"What I love about 'Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii' is how realistic the characters are. If you're a working young adult who's still into games and anime then you'll definitely love the flow of this one... it's like, not because you're an adult means you have to give up what you like... and while you don't go around announcing you're an anime/game/BL otaku, you do have your clique where you can be yourself.It's a love story but that's not the overbearing theme since there's also friendship and meeting new people and bonding and understanding even the people you've known for years.It's really a...light everyday scenario, a slice a life with characters that are lovable and situations that are so common. There are no moments of big reveals but each episode connects and slowly paints a picture of the characters growing/changing and you'll definitely find yourself routing for them XDI'm very much looking forward to season 2."
"Romance generally boils down to one of two things: A shoujo or a shonen romance.  The two differ in both style and content with the latter of which being more varied in the sorts of topics (as well as being more perverted) than its twin sister.  But despite this, very few shows actually manage to pull off the 'relationship' part of a romance, a key aspect that these genres brush to the side in favor for an idealized relationship.  And that's precisely where Wotaku shines.Story:As a new employee, Momose Narumi finds herself getting a fresh start at a different company far away from the previous...place that she was at.  Unbeknownst to her, an old classmate of hers, Hirotaka Nifuji, works at the same company and the two rekindle their friendship.  But on one night of drinking, Momose reveals why she switched workplaces in the first place, leading Nifuji to ask her if she would be willing to date him.  A bit rocky, but hey, he's getting his feet wet.Mixing the lifestyle of an otaku by surrounding the characters in their interests and going to large events with the ins and outs of a budding relationship, Wotaku is an interesting example of how to do a romance relationship right.  None of the characters are portrayed as perfect beings as everyone comedically bickers with one another about various otaku-related topics, as well as poke at each other's shortcomings (most often their respective partners), making it so that even the slightest thing can potentially set something off and have the next five minutes be about a debate about which guy should be on top of the other.Because of this, the show consistently has something to keep the audience engaged, as the very tiny cast of characters get all of the available screentime and utilize that to their advantage by slowly polishing their characteristics and personalities that has them feel more like people than characters.  But the biggest reason why Wotaku deserves all of the praise it gets is because it portrays romance right.Relationships are messy, and hardly any if any are perfect.  We see this here as every episode puts its main couple to the test on what it means to really be in a relationship.  Things are awkward, usually someone has to put their foot forward first, and compromises have to be made.  For a comedic show that's based around four adults who drown themselves in anime, manga, and various games, it's surreal to think that out of every romance I've seen, this is the one that portrays the 'in a relationship' status the best.  With each episode, you see a gradual change with Momose and Hirotaka growing closer together, which is supplemented with the other main couple in the series having their own saga of a long-standing relationship and its problems/compromises that've had to be made.Despite having a cutesy and typically comedic exterior, Wotaku has a surprising amount of subtext behind its otaku-ridden exterior that makes it such a worthwhile romance to watch.  I will say that the ending really could've been put together more thoroughly cause it feels like A-1 just sorta said ""We're done.  It's ending here."" cause nothing really feels complete as the show just sorta...ends.  However the journey to said ending was very well-made and certainly one of the show's high points.Overview:+  Very real portrayal of a relationship+  Comedy mixed well with more serious aspects-  Show just kinda...ends.  Like a ball being dropped.Characters:There're only six total characters.  But in a way, you could argue that there's really only four that matter a whole lot, as they make up the show's two main couples and as such, let the show laser focus on the relationships that they spend the entire runtime building up and portraying.For Narumi Momose and her partner, Hirotaka Nifuji, we're treated to a budding relationship between two people who...don't really hit it off that well at first.  Which is honestly a first for me, as rather than a clear attraction between two individuals, it's just two people who decide they'd be an ok fit for each other and see how things go.  Momose is a (for the most part), comedically bipolar character who can turn her voice and emotion at the drop of a hat, and Hirotaka is the game addict who stays calm no matter the situation.  What we're privy to is two people who slowly fill in the roles of boyfriend and girlfriend while not really seeming like that in any stage in the show.  It's this strange mix that gives the characters their identity, an unpredictable phenomenon that's enjoyable to watch because the developments aren't so clear cut from the start.Koyanagi and Kabakura, the two other 'main' characters that make up the other couple act more as the 'experienced' duo, being in a steady relationship for years that seems to be rocky at times.  The two have dividing interests, as for example, one's a fan of yuri while the other is a yaoi fan (I'll leave you to guess who is who), and the two constantly fight and bicker over small things.  Personally I like this relationship more than the main couple as comparatively, these two are more interesting cause the potential to tell a story with two individuals that're in such an on and off relationship from wanting to spend time together to never wanting to do anything with the other in a matter of minutes is an interesting story plot that you often never see without it becoming overbearing or annoying.Overview:+ Small cast with a lot of time devoted to them-  Secondary couple by comparison is more interestingArt:Produced by A-1...yeah, you know what they're capable of.  Bearing bright colors that really stand out, Wotaku is a consistent piece that on an episode by episode basis, rarely disappoints.  As well as using a variety of comedic faces to transition characters' expressions from normal to exaggeration at an instant, there's actually not much to say about the art cause it's not TOO standout, but still looks good enough to be pleasing to the eye without really doing anything to be anything beyond that.Sound:Sumika's 'Fiction' is a cheerful, upbeat song that screams 'catchy'.  It doesn't really have any unique properties about it, yet somehow it's gripping enough to be one of those OP tracks that you really don't want to skip over.  Haica's 'Kimi no Tonari' has this similar attribute too, as it's a poppy song that really shouldn't have any standout qualities, yet has this air about it that makes it worth listening to.  I can't really put my finger on it, but for all intents and purposes, a 'It's good and worth listening to' should suffice.Personal Enjoyment:Wotaku interested me upon reading its synopsis and for sure was a show that didn't disappoint.  It actually gave me more than I had originally thought was possible for the show since it touched upon a lot of things in a relationship that never actually get the time of day in a typical romance.  Namely, what happens AFTER the confession.Sure we don't really get a confession in the first place, but the fact that the show spent pretty much all of its runtime on exploring the couples' relationships and the rockiness and baggage that comes with one already gives it an attribute that very few shows can claim to have.  Because of this, I really enjoyed the show, and the otaku-based comedy that came along with it because it felt fresh and no joke was really reused so everything felt like new material.If you're looking for a romance show that's more about the actual relationship than the crush and confession (which let's be honest, we're all kinda more or less tired of seeing by this point), Wotaku is the show that fits the bill.  It's a surprising contender that showed up in the Spring 2018 season that proved to be more than first meets the eye, and definitely a show that's worth the watch."
"""Isn't this a typical anime about otakus?"" Yes. And No.""Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii"" (or ""Wotakoi"" for short) is an anime that is more known for its shorts than it is for its story. In other words, it is a mix of a rom-com and a sitcom. Every episode has its own short story, and honestly, you could skip around episodes and still be fine. Thus, the story and art for this anime didn't need to be exceptional, but it's still good.However, ""Wotakoi"" was definitely enjoyable, and perhaps the reason I personally found it so enjoyable was that I immediately fell in love with the...4 main characters. They are funny to watch as they go on with their days. They are all unique in their own ways, despite their similarities. Others may not like them at first, but they are bound to like at least one character by the end of the show.I would recommend ""Wotakoi"" to anyone who is looking for a short rom-com/sitcom. It's worth the try!"
"What a great anime. I recommend it to each and every otaku out there.STORY:From the first episode I said "" Hey I can relate to that! oh and that! and that! Oh *** that's my life!""There was the real part of the otaku life but the funny and interesting too. I found myself waiting for each episode every week. I felt like those guys where my friends because we had so many things in common.CHARACTERS:They managed to capture basic types of otakus but not in an annoying way. Each character had their negative and positive traits which made the anime both realistic but funny...and interesting too.ART/SOUND:Great opening, sweet background music which could fit every scene and not just random sounds.I loved it. Please watch it and share your opinion with me :) <3"
"NON-SPOILERWotakoi is a slice of life, comedy and office romance anime that you can enjoy at anyday.What I liked about it is:- Its not your typical high school love story, but more like a mature comedy where the characters are adults. Its a cozy romantic comedy in everyday life. I recommend it if you want to enjoy something easy and slow while being very fun to watch.- The relationships here feels real, and there is development. You will adore the characters and enjoy things with them. Specially if you either enjoy games, manga and anime ofc :D.- I think the voice acting...here was wonderful, it was endearing and matched with their characters.- The animation was very nice and high quality.- Likewise, the voice and the characters , I adore them both. If you want to know why, go and check it out :DWhat I did not like:- There was nothing I did not like, except for how short the series is. I know its because the anime has caught up with the manga, which is a pity I rather call it.Overall:I usually rate a series overall on how much I enjoyed it. Sometimes it might not have a wonderful story or life lessons etc, but I might still enjoy the prosess. Whats important is how much it got me engaged and the enjoyment. Wotakoi was a fresh story for me, where it did nowhere touch something typical and cliche, thumps up for that. It was funny, cute and enjoyable. It might not have a drama where it keeps you wanting answers. But it is able to keep you wanting more, you get that feeling of "" just one more ep""."
"Last season it was net juu susume and this season its wotakoi. This feels amazing. When the main characters of a slice of life anime are adults, it would definitely be a good watch. Wotakoi does not disappoint. It is the best. We as anime watchers or gamer or cos-players or as manga readers are thrilled when there is an anime that focuses on our plight as who we are and what we like. Wotakoi is about two pairs of otaku couples who are slowly easing into a relationship when they already have common grounds. It makes us wonder what it is like when two...ppl strike up a conversation that both of them are comfortable with especially when the topic is familiar to them.The character line up is fantastic. There are narumi and Hanako who are both fujoishi and they battle out ships the way way we yaoi fans do. Then there are kabakura and hirotaka, the cute redhead who loves his manga and anime as much as the megane who cant stay away from his gaming console. There is also the extremely adorable naoya and his potential tomboy partner.Every episode is blush worthy. I love the kabakura-hinako couple more than hirotaka-narumi. The former is steadier with a long history while the latter is fumbling with their relationship goals. It is frustrating that hirotaka-narumi pair takes forever to make a move and we still dont see them kiss. That one time between kabakura and hinako is all we get.  Nevertheless its is adorable whether its narumi cooking for hirotaka or them going on a date and ending up taking about otaku stuff or even the constant banter of hinako and kabakura. I cant get enough of the 11 episodes.Most importanytly it is great to crush on cute but grownup guys."
"Finally, I have found anime about romance + otaku daily life. This was one of many romance anime that are worth watching especially for otaku or just an anime lovers.Takes place at office (mostly) but actually I'm not bored with that. There were some fun recreation episode was also good. The characters personalities were also I have found unique and interesting to follow. Yeah, resemble slice of life genre anime.Graphics was great, really won't make you take a break even for a second to watch it while eating snack.I recommend this anime for 19-30 years old people. especially for those who working either full-time or...part-time"
"two 26 year old Otaku childhood friends who met again at work and decided to start datingthis anime is a fantasy to every adult anime fan to meet someone who shares passion for anime and games but sadly it wont come true to 95% of us so we're more than contempt with this anime for nowi loved it the atmosphere , the funny scenes , the slow paced romanceso far so goodi give it and 8 or more depending on the next few episodesi also liked how they included comedy to this romance so it wont become boring and to add enjoyment to...the slow paced events"
"One of the charming things about this comedic ""Slice of Life"" is that it appeals to a different generation by way of the age of the characters. Many popular shows feature 12~17 years old's (who are impossibly mature) to drive the plot; which is not inherently bad or surprising considering the consumer base for this and similar mediums of entertainment. The main characters here however are all late 20's and ""struggling"" with the fact that they don't really want to entirely grow up. Investing a lot of their time and money pursuing otherwise ""childish"" interests such as buying and playing computer games, reading/watching cartoons (manga/anime),...""dressing up"" (cosplay) and collecting dolls (figurines). This is the part that is relatable, being of similar age and also having similar interests/hobbies.I say ""struggling"" with quotations because their struggles aren't exactly complex or even necessarily that hard. They all work sufficiently paid jobs that afford them to live relatively normal and adequate lives and you couldn't honestly call them anything close to dysfunctional, the struggle is more about their social standing than anything else on account of the negative opinion of ""Otaku's"" in society at large. That being said, the relative tameness of their Otaku quirks/eccentricities does make them more broadly relatable. It would probably be more entertaining and deep in the long run to deal with less functional characters, but the wholesome-ness of the show is still rather pleasant and it wouldn't be fair to judge a show and it's end goal by something it may never have set out to achieve.There is a slight culture difference here where these struggles don't entirely translate to the West where there's not as much focus on work ethic (relatively speaking that is, i don't want to imply people in the West don't work hard; but Japan has a word specifically for people who work themselves to death (""Karoshi"")) and a much more liberal stance on sociological elements thanks to the evolution and spread of sub cultures that afford people today more freedom in their interests without as much judgement. So some impact might be lost on a non-Asian audience.For the most part though the show is just a general pleasure to watch with amusing and relatable gags based around how nerdy they are and at the age they are. The only things that are really feel out of place is how conveniently everything typically works out. There's no real sense of friction or resistance, with almost every challenge resolving almost as fast as it appears; that and the male protagonist is something of a Mary Sue. Being highly reliable, highly competent (despite how little effort he is shown putting in) and extremely attractive; with multiple scenes both inside the office work space and out in public of groups of girls swooning over him (much to the ignorance of the female lead). In a show that is largely exploiting Otaku stereotypes this is one they seem to have taken liberty with.The art is decent, with several amusing meta references to shows like JoJo's B.A. and Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji (along with some other name drops). The characters are so-so (but do feature some really good voice acting), being quite average, yet charmingly so in some ways. The show really becomes better than the sum of its otherwise remarkably average parts; but i should say that there is definitely some subjective bias involved in that conclusion."
"When I first went into this show, I went in fully expecting the most stereotypical of romance anime series filled with endlessly repeated character troupes and jokes constantly told. But hey, everybody is wrong sometimes!I was extremely pleasantly surprised by the pacing and humor of Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii. A tale about two people entering adulthood while embracing their embarrassing, childhood interests, while ALSO falling in love, brought forth a completely heart warming feeling. The romance skips the unnecessary fan service and keeps the relationships growth slow and steady, showing both the better and worse moments of it. This makes for one of the...most realistic romance anime I have personally seen so far, and is a large reason for why I enjoyed watching.The humor largely incorporates references to other anime or video games, which is super fitting for a show following two otakus, and in my opinion is very charming. I often found myself having to control the volume of my laughter when I was watching this at ungodly hours (no regrets though).I would most definitely recommend Wotaku ni Koi was Muzukashii to anybody who enjoys a quirky, colorful, and overall fun show, and is tired of seeing the main couple fall in love within the first 10 minutes of the show (as I am).Plus, the ""falls in love with childhood friend later in life"" story line is something I will never get tired of."
"When I picked up Wotakoi this season, I didn't expect much. It appeared to be just another rom-com to add to the old ""completed"" list. To my surprise, however, Wotakoi ended up flooring me for one, extremely simple reason: it made me laugh. I'm not talking about the amused exhale out of the nose that many forms of comedic entertainment usually elicit, but laugh out loud kind of amusement. In and of itself, that's an impressive feat. Wotakoi joins the company of shows like Konosuba and Inferno Cop, to name a couple, that have really made me laugh like that.Now, you'd have to look fairly...hard to find something that Wotakoi does specially or differently from other rom-coms, besides just doing it better than most. The main place Wotakoi excels is in its lack of dependence on relationship drama. Not once does it hang on the tried and true romantic tension for longer than a single episode, which is extremely refreshing for a genre that seems to be synonymous with drama fueled by miscommunication, jealousy, etc. That isn't to say that Wotakoi never uses such tactics, but the fact that it doesn't use them as crutches makes Wotakoi a cut above the rest.There are other positives to Wotakoi, of course, like its fantastically groovy opening, its small cast of lovable characters, each with very distinctive personalities and tastes, and, strangely enough, its hand animation. I'm not joking, Wotakoi's hand animation may be the best I've ever seen in any form of animation. Just watch the opening and pay attention to the character's hands. It's mindbogglingly good.That being said, Wotakoi isn't exactly the perfect anime. I mean, it's only 11 episodes. Who decided that was a good idea? More seriously, if you don't understand the references that Wotakoi makes, you may have a hard time appreciating some of the humor involved, which can detract from Wotakoi's accessibility.To be honest, there aren't many negatives to speak of regarding Wotakoi. It just won't be for everyone. Not everyone wants to watch a romantic comedy with far more comedy and slice of life than actual romance. And that's okay. Wotakoi can inhabit the nerdy rom-com niche and safely say that it does it best."
"- Finally my review of Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku, beginning with the story, which soon enough I notice that it is extremely simple but expected of a romantic comedy anime; the story is rather simple but interesting, since it is a work of romantic comedy focused on adults something difficult to find nowadays, in general, there is not much to say about the story, it is a simple story with a proposal different but interesting.- Now on the technical side, this is the weakest point of Wotakoi, the technical part leaves much to be desired mainly in its visual as a whole, even...for a romantic comedy; the animation is also very simple; the only thing that really stands out is the soundtrack; now about the direction, this is a complicated case, the direction in general is very weak also, although it manages to create a good scene of comedy from time to time, however surely the direction could have been better.- About the characters, all I have to say is that they are good characters, especially the protagonists, since the coadjuvants could certainly have been better developed, but the cast as a whole is yes very good, could have been better but still are good characters.- Conclusion, Wotakoi is a simple romantic comedy, but with a different proposal, has good characters, good story, but has an extremely weak technical part, as well as his direction; in general, I recommend yes Wotakoi, it is not the best romantic comedy of the spring season 2018, but still it is a good anime, I recommend it for sure !! 💛😉💙 !!- My favorite song by Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku 💛 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkGEOT7JhXw- My page about animes on facebook 💙 : https://www.facebook.com/pg/AnimeSpaceBR.050/posts/?ref=page_internal💛😉💙 !!"
"TL;DR: Otaku romance, with many otaku references / content. Close to no character / romance development though._______________While it was pretty entertaining to watch and very well done, I can still ""only"" give this anime a 8/10 score.That's for 2 reasons;- The characters basically don't develop at all. And neither does their romance. They get together in the first episode and it stays as that throughout the whole show. There are some romantic scenes between them, but overall they still act like two otaku-friends rather than a couple. It would've been great to at least see them grow closer over time. I would've expected more...character / romance development over time. I would even go that far that you could arbitrarily shuffle the episodes and you wouldn't notice a difference (apart from those introducing new characters of course).- The show doesn't have a real ending. I didn't know how many episodes it has while I watched it, so after watching the last episode I was pretty baffled.. ""wait.. that's it?"" No development in either of both couples, and the relationship between Nao and that otaku tomboy was left pretty much as is too. After all, the final episode could've just been an episode like any other.Even with those two huge flaws I still decided to rate it 8, as I can't deny that I enjoyed watching it a lot. It covers a lot of otaku stuff, as each character is an otaku in their way."
"So far as of writing this I feel like this is less a romance anime and more a Otaku slice of life that just happens to be told from the view-point of 2 Otaku couples. I am using the term couples fairly lightly though since I feel like it's honestly closer to just 4 friends that just happen to be equal parts male and female and proclaim to be together when there's very little actual romance. So far I would say if you are looking for quality romance to probably look elsewhere, while this show does a very few really great moments, it's maybe 1...every 3.5 episodes so far.Basically I went in expecting a slow but gradual romantic development or even a off the bat relationship that slowly explores the ""afterwards"" of getting up the courage to pop that question. It's just not really there. The last 3 episodes in particular have been fairly bland with no real plot developement at all.The art style is pleasing and so is the sound. The Character's are all stereo-typical cardboard cut out's but at least they are done well.  The story started strong and held out for a bit but the last few episodes has me bored.If things change after the series is finished I will either change or delete this review. Not sure how many episodes are left but if it's a standard 12 episode anime I imagine the last 5 better be gushing with content or my score will fall lower.Edit: Finally finished this, and I have to say, the last 4 episodes had alot more romance packed in it but also tried to shoe horn in another trope couple and nothing at all got resolved or satisfied.TL;DR This is one big Commercial for the Manga/ Light Novel. The anime will leave you fealing unfulfilled other than some of the stellar moments."
"TLDR; Slice of life about adultsTo start off the bat, I was expecting an anime called ""Love is hard for Otaku"" to be about the trials and trepidation of finding love as an otaku. It's not. It's a slice of life collection of short stories about a pair of couples going about their everyday lives.That having been said, it's not the worse for it. Once you get around the fact that you were slightly misled it's a very enjoyable anime. The characters are spot on as realistic yet likeable people doing things which I would expect them to do (more or less, it is still...an anime!). Each episode effectively tells a different story from their lives and are mostly standalone, but still enjoyable."
"I'm gonna start off by saying I objectively consider this anime is good. However I did not truly enjoy it. I laughed and related to a few bits of the story and the characters. It's a nice slice of life overall.The anime does well to show how otakus experience relationships between each others. The main and secondary couples are fleshed out enough so that they don't feel generic. There are some tropes here and there but hey, tropes came originally from real life.If you'd like some harmless, mindless slice of life this is for you.However I disliked the lack of a sense of...direction, even though I know that this is not what it was made for. This is why i consider it a good anime objectively.As I said, the anime goes nowhere. The main characters get together and that's it. There's not much else except learning about side characters or the main characters's backstories."
"Wotakoi is a romcom focusing on nerds falling in love and having a nerdy lifestyle. It was a really enjoyable and cute anime to watch for me, I was never bored, and it was hilarious as well. It tells the story of Momose a girl transferring to a new company where she meets her childhood friend Hirotaka, they meet up later to catch up and Hirotaka suggest that he becomes her boyfriend so they can be happy being otakus forever, they also befriend the other nerdy couple Kabakura and Koyonagi. This anime was made by A-1 pictures, based on the Japanese webmanga series by Fujita.Pros:-Great...characters-Good sountrack-Stunning visuals-Shows the lifestyle of Otakus in Japan in a fun casual way-Explores the boyfriend girlfriend relationship in a work office setting-Is really fun,hilarious and enjoyable to watch-Is relatable for nerds-Explores the otaku norm in JapanCons:-Has no romantic development in both setting, and sometimes romantic scenes are made for jokes or ends in jokes-Episodes showcase pretty much the same thingswhere they go to work, get a drink, have dinner, have a nerdy conversation, buy manga hang out together, sometimes go on dates, that's pretty much it, feels repetitive for meOverall Wotakoi is a fun anime about nerd culture and what it feels like to be in a relationship as a otaku, it was really enjoyable, plus is extremely relatable to us nerds out there especially for gamers, manga readers, and anime watchers like me. I had a lot of fun watching it, and I would recommend it to anime fans out there as it's refreshing to see nerd culture tackled in a anime. I'm going to give this a 8/10 for my personal enjoyment and overall anime rating."
"If you want a light romantic comedy with lots of funny moments, look no further! This show is entertaining as it is sweet and refreshing.I've browsed and watched through a few romcom shows, but this one feels most relatable and enjoyable to watch. From the scene taking place at a corporate office, to the portrayal of relationship, it doesn't feel forced and doesn't leave me feeling annoyed by the usual push-and-pull relationship dynamic.-----StoryThe story revolves around 4 characters (2 MCs, 2 supporting characters) who are supposedly working adults, and comes to no surprise, hardcore otakus! The main couple both find it hard to have a...relationship as an otaku, because either they devote their life to their hobbies, or because non-otaku are grossed out by the MC. The 4 characters also keep their hobbies a secret from their relatives and other friends, and fortunately they are able to find a safe haven in this newfound circle of friends.One of the strength of the story is that it is really simple, so it is very light and a great choice when you need a respite and a little laugh. They dont really tell the story outside of their little circle, so the focus is in the MCs at their workplace, doing their hobbies, and the relationship dynamic between them. During their work time, they do their job as usual, while sometimes making time for their hobbies during lunch or before work (playing games, watching anime, etc).  Several times in the story, they seem to interact with fellow coworkers and other people, and are seen as normal people and professional adult, showing that otakus are just like other people, only with high devotion to hobbies.How they stretch the interaction only between these 4 characters (while later on they introduce 2 more supporting characters) throughout the 11 episode is amazing. I never got bored watching them talking to each other, their friendly banters, heated arguments, and sweet moments.On the romance part, it is very PG-13 (they even only kissed once I think), not a lot of PDA, but nonetheless very adorable! It is quite realistic because it shows their lives very closely, so mundane relationship moments are to be expected. But, how they just let each other be themselves, enjoy each other's presence, no annoying miscommunication drama are a pleasant portrayal of a mature relationship. The romantic relationship between the MC seem to be transactional at first, with them only exchanging favors, but it develops slowly into a loving relationship throughout the end. I JUST NEED MORE FLUFFY CUTESY MOMENTS, PLEASE!As for plot, the series doesn't have any significant plot. The pilot episode pretty much gave the rough background story to start you off, and it has a few introductory episode to new character but it's also not substantial.-----CharacterAll of the characters have different characters and interest, so it is really fun watching them individually and their interaction with each other. They also have different focus of interest (gaming, manga, BL, etc). Sometimes their preferences clash, sometimes they agree, quite realistic portrayal of real-life interaction. In later episode, they introduce 2 more of supporting character, who also have their fair share of struggle to find relationship as otakus, and I guess would later on be a part of the otaku circle.There isn't much character development throughout the series. The development mostly show in the MCs' relationship as they slowly show how deeply they love the other. But character development isn't really necessary for this kind of story, I like how they keep things at its own pace. I just simply can't wait for the next season!-----ArtI think the art is very befitting of their genre and story. The characters' imagery suit their respective personality, enhanced with the talented voice actors who could perfectly match their voice with the characters. Since it's comedy, the characters are sometimes shown in chibi, or having a very funny expression to match the situation.The cute pastel-colored background and typical shoujo glittery effect are very suitable for each scene and amplify the cuteness of this anime! They sometimes use pixel bit textbox referenced from in RPG game, not holding back on the different type of otaku reference.-----Overall it is very enjoyable to watch. There's no significant up and down moment. The flow are kept relatively stable, it has its own way of doing ""awww"" moment without exaggeration, and it doesn't annoy you with a frustrating romance drama, making it pleasant and easy-to-digest."
"""Wotakoi: Love Is Hard For Otaku"" is a cutesy, somewhat random comedy-romance anime based on a group of adults trying to make their way in a tragic love life (meanwhile being an Otaku, whether it be game or anime). The whole gist of these comedic skits is to show what it'd be like to be haunted by your interests in the dating world, which if you think about it it's somewhat relatable. For an anime based upon this culture, I'd say it seals the deal quite perfectly and in turn, allows us to resonate within it. However, as someone who mainly watches romance anime, I'd...like to express that my expectations for this show were not met.The genres included in this anime, the main ones being romance and comedy, were extremely lacking. I found myself watching to find out where the story would go rather than watching because it was funny or remotely included said genres. I found the punchlines landed in some instances, then completely failed in others. To top it off, the amount of romance increased and decreased like a rollercoaster throughout the anime and even anti-climaxed when it would have fitted best.The characters would most likely be my favourite part of the show, as I was able to become excited at the appearance of a favourite character. Even though the anime was short, I can say that the characters stuck with me and made me wonder how they continued within the manga. Nevertheless, I disliked how the character's relationships developed more than the actual characters did. I found it being a repetitive quality that each character would have a singular moment of development, then immediately snap back to their previous state. It also became evident that character tropes were left unfinished or discontinued by the end of the anime.The soundtrack in this anime would have to be the least memorable part for me. When inquiring about this factor, I genuinely had to pull up the soundtrack and listen to it to give a decent outlook. From what I listened to, the music wasn't necessarily terrible but wasn't exactly fitting in the scenes it was used. Alongside this, for the life of me, I could not stand the small pieces of narration and the little noise that came along with it. It was incredibly irritating and jarred me every time it happened. Although, the opening for this anime is rather enjoyable and left my friends and I humming it for hours on end.Overall, would I recommend this to a friend? Unlikely, to be honest. While it was entertaining in moments, it didn't have the consistency a rom-com needs to stay afloat. This is only something I'd recommend to watch if there was nothing else."
I like all the characters and their developments throughout the episodes. The artwork is pretty good. This anime definitely deserves a second season. Overall this anime is really enjoyable. I'm running out of words to put zzzzzz. (　≖╭╮≖). The opening is also good tho I can't stop replaying it. I usually skip anime opening. But this one's just too good for me to skip. This anime is so good wish this could happen to me in real life. God please find me a weeb gamer boyfriend. Especially the ones who would accept a fujoshi like me *winks*. ୧(๑•̀⌄•́๑)૭. Don't all weebs want this type of...story? Jeez this anime is just sooo relatable.
"This is one of my favorite anime for some reason. First of all, I love how the characters start dating in the first episode. You rarely see rom-com animes to jump straight into relationships. Usually, characters will have a crush and then drag on that feeling for the WHOLE season until we finally see them confess... BUT HOLD UP, something ALWAYS goes wrong like some dumbass side character or that the person somehow couldn't hear the confession over the fireworks OR SOME SHIT. I'm so done with that. The important part is not the confession or crushing. It's what comes AFTER. So I really love...how this anime concentrates more on the relationship itself. On top of that, the characters are adults that have jobs and hobbies rather than the typical high school anime series. You rarely see this perspective. This may be because many feel that romance and the ""fun"" all happen in high school. However, this anime shows that this isn't the case. I love these two parts of it and this might be why I've ended watching this series so many times and even bought the manga. It's refreshing to watch an anime that's both realistic (although you never really see such attractive otakus in real life) in the sense of having adult characters that work and also have healthy relationships (they may have some small ups and downs in the relationship, but these problems only strengthen the character's relationships with each other). I wish they released season 2, and I can't wait for the second season! Definitely will recommend although it's not the typical rom-com movie!"
"This show is very true to the manga it is based on. It is a genuine slice of life anime that showcases the romantic relationship of two couples (maybe three if it gets another season). It doesn't have any petty jealousy that most romance shows have and focuses on the developing relationship of two childhood friends instead (with a ton of otaku references). I agree with Kabakura that Ranka is the best! (Macross F reference). Because it was fairly mature and not childish, I really enjoyed it. The studio also did a great job on their game graphics whenever they were shown! It made it...even more realistic to me. You will probably relate to a lot of things in this anime if you like games, anime, manga, collectibles, and more! I say give it a chance and then go read the manga. There is just one more volume that needs to be published in English (technically two, but they do two in one)."
"Story: 6Art: 6Character: 4Enjoyment:3Overall:5I'm going to try keep this short so I'll just summarise why I  gave this the scores that I did.Story: The story is pretty average, it's just a romance between some otakus without any overdramatic crap that they have in most romance anime, also it's set in an office which isn't that common. but to sum it up,the main characters got together within 1 or 2 episodes, and by the end the relationship felt liked it hadn't progressed (also it's got the generic ""childhood friend"" cliche)....Art: Although it isn't something I'd personally like, it was actually pretty nice for the most part.Character: The characters kind of bothered me, they were pretty close to their 30's or something and yet they acted like ten year olds, which was already kind of annoying but the moments where they were actually acting their age just felt kind of awkward and forced.Enjoyment: I am not a fan of slice of life comedies, they always come off as bland and by the end it feels like the story has gotten nowhere, which was exactly the case with this show, but I don't tend to like slice of life in general (apart from a few exceptions).Overall I'd give it a 5, it isn't the worst but it's probably not something that I'd want to watch again, if you're into slice of life romcom's then I'd recommend this, but if you're like me then don't do this yourself ;-;, anyway that's all I had to say feel free to correct me if I got anything wrong."
"Just wholesome and cute romcom between the four major characters. The two couples have different dynamics, and I enjoyed both of them. Besides being cute, there’s also constant comedy and jokes.Got introduced to more terms and places in Japan that I have never heard of before, which was pretty cool.The only downside is that there’s not a lot of drama going on. Because of this, there wasn’t much strong emotions in the journey of the main couple trying to learn to be a couple.But overall, I absolutely enjoyed the wholesomeness and comedy. Really hope there will be season 2. 8/10"
"I like the story,but i just want this anime to get Movie Or Season 2.LIke I REALLY REALLY LIKE IT!!I like the brother and his friends.Who i thought it boy,HAHAHA.But sadly his a girl who cut her hair short and wear boy shirt(MAYBE?).In the end of manga so so GOOD,Yeah i like them to marriage.HAHAHA(BLUSH)In the end of story,i think they will live along besideI like when the part of opening song!I like when the part she try to joke with...the guy blue hairThe story tell us about how romance TRULLY aboutI also always smile when the scene of them(hehe)I like EVERY Episode or Chapter in this story,really-reallu muchIts really good i recomended to you guys!-This is the end,I hope you guys watch it!-"
"The animation wasn't that detailed, could have been better. I expected more of an ending, was a little disappointed in the last episode. Would have liked some big event or that they actually spend time together... But.. OP and ED slaps! Would have also liked more character and relationship development- both Narumi and Haru's relationships did not really progress that much throughout the show.. But loved Hirotaka- amazing character and very cute of course! Related to his character a little and liked the parts where he seemed more ""human""(expressed his feelings and such). Also enjoyed the mini game aspects and the cute game characters. Simple...heartwarming short easy to watch slice of life."
"Honestly, I wasn't sure what to think of this series at first as I read the first volume of the manga before deciding to head into the anime after hearing that it's more cohesive. The manga definitely did not blow me away and I ended up feeling kind of confused because it isn't very linear and jumps around a lot, so I was definitely underwhelmed heading into the anime. I was quickly absorbed though and the characters grew on me so much - this definitely translated better on screen for me as it followed a more linear storyline that linked different events together in a...more cohesive manner, and the humour really hit better to the point where I actually laughed out loud sometimes (which is very rare for me). Honestly, this was great and I absolutely devoured the series in any spare time I had."
"looking for something light-hearted, simple, and yet entertaining? this is definitely it!!not your 'typical' romcom since the story is set on adults and honestly its a really nice breath of fresh air. i personally love how the characters aren't always super nervous and always jealous of everything. they Are adults after all. they've had past relationships, lived their lives on their own, etc. and how the characters feel ""real"" ? of course they're still anime characters and they're a bit exaggerated on some points but they Feel real. they have their own doubts and insecurities inside their relationship and while they want and try to...talk about it with their partner but cant exactly say it directly, those parts felt really nice and i relate to it a lot.the anime isn't something ground breaking, super different or special, its just Nice. simple, entertaining, and Real.the animation is enjoyable for me personally. the op and ed are also really nice!! their voice actors fit them well and the sound effects are great.i think its a good anime that you should at least give a try :)"
"This anime is damn entertaining with all of its ""otaku"" humors spilled all over the entire series. It is fun and relaxing to watch, just the right anime for the otakus who's looking for a non-emotional show. It doesn't have a progressive plot. Instead it portrays different situations in each episode, and that's where the progress start to show. But each of the episode's progression is not really unified for the whole series. It's purpose is to give laughter and relaxing time for the viewers. I'm a little bit dissapointed on the last two episodes, where a new character was introduced when the series is...already going to end. They could have played more with the situations they've given in the previous episodes with that new character. However, I guess they're just following the manga, if I'm not mistaken. But overall, the show is really cute and fun to watch. I really love the mix of maturity and ""otaku attitude"" the characters portraying and the cute pairing makes me want to hope for another season."
"Wotakoi, in short, is an office rom-com about this girl who tries to hide her ""nerd"" (anime, manga, gaming [and yaoi]) lifestyle, gets found out then gets dumped, then gets a new job then starts dating her childhood friend who is a hardcore otaku. There isn't really any drama, there are some nice romance moments but it's ultimately lacking there given that they had to stick to the idea that the male mc is a hopeless otaku. Overall, the show is pretty much bang average really, but it does well enough in the comedy department to give it a 7 for me. One review on...the front page suggested the comedy was poor due to bad timing, and that honestly is a valid critique. Some jokes were kinda immature, poorly timed cringe, etc. But I found myself laughing out loud at least once per episode. Watch 1-2 episodes and if the comedy is up your alley, its a good indicator for the rest of the series. As for characters, the female mc is average, the male mc showed hints of development but they just squashed it in favor of punchlines which was kinda disappointing given they foreshadowed something serious just enough for me to believe it but don't be mistaken, this is no-drama, no-plot. Any drama is for the sake of comedy. Going back to the comedy, there were some really funny moments, for example the main mc and the deuteragonist are with their younger coworkers and they are lusting over two girls in the workplace which happens to be the girlfriends of the mc and his friend. Like I said, may or may not be funny, but I liked it and thought the show was easy and fun to watch, which goes a long way in my rating system. I thought romance wise, koyanagi and kabakura (green hair girl and orange hair guy) had better moments then the ""main"" characters (koyanagi and kabakura get so much screen time that they might as well be called mc's asw). In conclusion, Wotakoi has an specific target audience so if you like rom-coms and find the comedy to be up your alley, it's worth a watch without a doubt. 7/10"
"Just kind of meh. I was watching for a romance and there were very few romantic moments. I enjoyed the slice of life elements revolving around otaku life and work life, however. This really shines when it does its slice of life thing rather than the romance.That said, when a slice of life is set up around two couples, you kind of have to review the romantic relationships involved so here we go:Narumi/Hirotaka relationship review:I love a good 'quiet guy, enthusiastic girl' relationship--this was that kind of relationship but it was not a good one.Hirotaka is like two steps away from hikkikomori, not because he...is afraid but because he is uninterested. But ultimately he knows what he wants and is able to vocalise it. He is quietly quirky with genuine emotions if you just. I really liked him.Meanwhile, Narumi was a bubbly energetic sort, likeable and sympathetic at first glance,  until you realise she doesn't seem to want to commit or look for anything deeper. She never seemed to be invested in the relationship, unless her desire to cook for Hirotaka in a later episode was meant to be a way of showing her feelings for him. But that was the extent of it. Mostly she seemed slightly possessive or just going through the motions. Whenever she looked out for him in vulnerable moments, there was never any actual depth of emotion beyond friendship expressed.I found myself watching and waiting for any crumb of affection she let drop for him. Not a very comfortable feeling while watching a romantic couple.The relationship was really stagnant and we didn't see anything really change or develop--no first kiss, the question of when they might have s*x etc... all really normal stuff that you go through with new relationships was just never addressed.The attitude to the relationship was, I'm paraphrasing Hirotaka here: 'let's go at a slow pace if that's what you need'. But the show never addressed why she might need that--prime opportunity for character development here, and we missed it. Is she vulnerable because of past relationships, does she have some kind of trauma? No hint of any kind of explanation. We're left to form one of our own, and in the absence of evidence, it comes off as she's unwilling to engage in the relationship physically or emotionally because she didn't really want to be with him, she just wanted *a* relationship.We got a lot of hints that Hirotaka really liked her since they were childhood friends, and no corresponding reveals from her that she might feel the same way.They were so distant from one another emotionally despite the fact that they were dating, that I found myself wondering just how much was implied because of cultural expectations on what it was appropriate to show in a non-explicit anime show... but come on, in a romance anime you expect to have a few moments where people break the boundaries of politeness among friends and work colleagues...Hirotaka deserves better imho and I hoped Narumi would turn into the kind of girlfriend he deserved. She didn't.Weirdly, and i'll note it here because i dont know where else to put it, Narumi was saved from becoming really unlikeable by the introduction of Hirotaka's younger brother Naoya. Naoyya was adorable and Narumi actually had some really cute platonic scenes with him, that made her more sympathetic again. It was just weird that she had those scenes with the brother of the guy she was dating, and not the guy she was actually dating.Kabakura/Hanakao relationship review:I love the kind of relationship where they are constantly finding excuses to fight over dumb stuff but then get really protective over one another. this was that kind of thing.The only downside was when two characters ( I think it was Narumi and Hanako?) were talking about how in some relationships people fight performatively but then are nicer to one another in private, so we're given to understand that that's the set-up. and then in the next episode or so, we see Hanako and Kabakura fighting while they're alone, which undermines that idea and makes you think maybe they're never happy.It seemed like that was a weird writing mis-step though, because ultimately H/K were way more real with one another and clearly more comfortable around one another than Narumi and Hirotaka are. Their fights are somewhat performative but they're still doing it because they like to do it. I also liked one particular interaction where Kabakura finally lets Hanakao drag him into BL and he gets super hooked, so I liked that he was able to take part in her interests and let go of his preconceptions.I don't know how to describe their comfortable silence other than that K/H felt like they were doing their own otaku hobbies next to each other in companionable silence because they actually wanted to be around one another, and N/H were doing their otaku hobbies next to each other because they wanted to do their hobbies. Where K/H were comfortable, N/H were awkard. i know the theme is that love is hard because otaku are awkward, but N/H never found a way past that awkwardness.All that said, while they were comfortable with one another, K/H really did fight an awful lot. I like a slap-slap-kiss dynamic but it was more like slap-slap-slap-slap-slap-kiss.Naoya/Kou relationship:A potential budding romance stemming from friendship and a gender misunderstanding. Kou is the closest person to an otaku and where Hirotaka is two steps away from hikkikomori, Kou is one step. Definitely could have been a really sweet romance story, had Kou not been introduced LITERALLY two episodes before the end of the series. As it is, we got a few hints of where the relationship could be going, but the series ended before these two side characters got a chance to become mains in their own right.Other notes:I also found it quite frustrating that the characters rarely ever said what they meant, they talked around the feelings they had about relationships in general a LOT, but there wasn't a lot of actual discussion about how they felt about the actual people they were in those relationships WITH. I know that's basically the hallmark of Japanese culture--but in real life you at least have the excuse of not actually knowing these people and it not being appropriate to ask. In fiction the whole point is to get to know more about a character's emotional depth. If we can't have it shown, can we at least have it told?One random thing that was refreshing is that there were very few contrived coincidences, silly misunderstandings, or people getting upset over nonsense. If someone misunderstood something or behaved stupidly the others couldn't help but find it funny.I've really kind of slammed this show in my review--i didn't really hate it--but it certainly wasn't set up to provide any cathartic moments and very few really sweet ones.It's definitely a slice of life show, not a romance, and it shines in episodes like the christmas one where Narumi sees Naoya wearing the santa suit. I'd be interested in reading the manga to see if it does the relationships any better."
"TL;DR, if you enjoyed reading the manga you will most likely enjoy watching the anime.The anime stays very faithful to the manga where the only real changes were changing the order of certain scenes to help episodes flow. Example of this are how two of the characters met taking place in the first episode instead of flashbacks later on like in the manga.The anime manages to capture the humor of the manga and, at least for me, it was great to see these characters come alive and off the page and onto my screen.I found the character dynamics cute and humorous. I think a part...I got a real kick out of was a scene where the characters shop for manga since it paralleled mine and my boyfriends manga shopping experiences recently.All that being said, I can see how someone who has not read the manga may not find enjoyment the anime. For me, part of the fun came from seeing the stories from the manga come to life with animation. Some of the stories don't translate all that well into an episodic format and some episode fell a bit flat and dragged on. I would highly recommend reading the manga before delving into the anime as I think you will gain more enjoyment from it that way.However if I had to recommend one or the other I would recommend the manga as I find the story is better enjoyed in a written format.The OP is a bop though, add it to your playlists."
"Hi everyone! I just finished watching the anime a few hours ago and right off the bat I can say that I adore it. Personally, I am not the biggest fan of Shojo, I usually enjoy the romance/slice of life genre through other things such as Asian dramas (cries in single). So I will be the first to say that this anime pleasantly surprised me!The characters are extremely fun and vibrant, you can't help but smile at your screen when watching them interact with each other. The voice actors truly did a great job bringing them to life. The setting of the story itself, given...that it is about four adults is also very refreshing because from my experience, these kinds of stories often only take place in high school.I have heard people criticizing the show for not really being all that romantic, or failing to be a good romance anime in general. I'd have to disagree with that. While it lacks the usual fan service or dramatic plot lines, it fully makes up for by providing an insight into romantic maturity. The fact that Nifuji and Momose are in love, and that Koyanagi and Kabakura are in love is obvious, it does not need to be shown through kissing, sex or contrived dialogue. They simply portray love in its unconditional and natural form. As an example, one of the biggest lessons this anime can teach any couple is that being with each other, sometimes means that sacrifices must be made. Throughout the show, Kabakura and Nifuji have to deal with Momose's and Koyanagi's obsession with yaoi. They let them enjoy what they want and sometimes do things that maybe they do not want to do themselves, but they still want to make them happy.Personally, I am not in to yaoi myself but this theme can really be applied to anything. We all have something we enjoy/are obsessed with, we might even feel ashamed about it at times. This anime shows that the right person, will embrace you, including the things you love, and accept you. Pure romantic maturity, I can not stress this enough.Also, can we please take a moment to appreciate how amazing Nifuji is? I feel like once you reach a certain age, you can see some flaws in romance anime or dramas and see how some of these relationships, while fun and entertaining to watch, can sometimes be very toxic and unhealthy if they happened IRL. Of course, not ALL of them are like this, but it is prevalent. What's great about this show is, that it has none of that toxicity! I am a 19-year old female, and I have never had a boyfriend before but if (by some miracle) I do in the future, I want him to be like Nifuji. So kind, comforting and compassionate. (all of this applies to Kabakura too btw, we stan)In short, this is a beautiful story, I am holding on to hope that we will get a season two because I need these characters in my life again.Thanks for reading :)p.s: we must protect Naoya at ALL COSTS"
"Wotaku is a fun office slice-of-life that centers on the romantic relationships between four office workers who are also otakus.Each episode is well paced and able to hit the comedic moments. The romantic moments are also sweet and somewhat grounded to reality. What I liked about Wotaku's romance is that rather than focus on the pursuit of romance, it focuses on what comes after. What do the characters do as a couple? How do they maintain their relationship? The chemistries between the two pairs are also nice and funny. When things get serious, that chemistry strengthens and ends with a sense of levity. I...love the characters! They are so expressive and funny.The only nitpick I have with this show is that it ended so soon. Just when another romance began to bloom. I also want to see more office romance and the ending didn't feel like an ending.The animation and art are nice. The OP is addicting. The OST is great.Overall, watch Wotaku! It's the office slice of life romance you are waiting for."
"You know when you see a meme online about a situation, and you find it relatable, but then you browse the comments and it's a bunch of people saying that it could never happen in real life?You start to think ""Wow, these people lives are boring/ they haven't live throught that yet""That is how I feel reading reviews about romance in MAL.But Wotakoi is worse. For Wotakoi is a seinen. Regardless of where it is serialized, it is a story based primarly on an adult perspective. So the relationships are naturally harder for younger folks to swallow. The perspectives in this show about work, love,...relationships and the world is one that you don't grasp that easily until you reach a certain point in your life. Unfortunately anime is a medium that is not segregated enough, and sometimes we just don't get it...Wotakoi does very well what it proposes to do as a slice of life. It is relatable to the right audience, and touching in the adult dose. It is not remarkably funny, although it has its moments.The art is not great, but it is good. The sountrack is weird sometimes, but it is not a big issue.This is a good show for adult anime lovers to enjoy."
"Wotakoi tries it best to cater to an audience still too in love with anime but are too busy with their 9-5 jobs. As the setting of the Anime, so is for the people it caters to.As I had mentioned, Wotakoi is an anime best suited for people who're although still obviously avid fans of Anime but can't make too much time because the Adult world is unforgiving and scary and bills, and bills, and bills. When you've got too much time OUT of your hand, Wotakoi is good enough to serve as little servings to just ease in. It's an anime that doesn't...demand a binge watch. And that's good. We've already too much to think about, in the end, an Anime is just a sweet escape that we all could need.The romance here is not as spicy as a Romeo and Juliet but just a little pinch of sugar just enough to satisfy, so don't expect heart wrenching, tear jerking moments happening anytime in the show. In fact, admittedly, the romance between the two MC, felt rushed, but as intended, since, the show was not about the happy ending but about what comes after that confession.What I do love about this anime is, forgive an old man for ranting, is that it reminds us that even Adults are still allowed a life outside their cubicles. That one can be a hardworking adult without giving too much of our lives away.I have nothing technical to say about the Anime, since, for the most part, that's already been for me by the other critiques here. But heed my advice, take every review here with a grain of salt. You should be the one to judge your own enjoyment. We're nothing more than just MAL users like you here."
"The reason I watched this:  I watched this because it was a romance anime. The other reason is that it was popping up on my YouTube recommendation and I was liking the small clips I was seeing. The concepts of otaku in love made me want to check it out.Story:  The story is about 2 friends, Hirotaka and Narumi, meeting up in a company when they haven't seen each other since middle school. They are both otaku and basically based on circumstance you learn why she moved to the new company and at the same time you learn why they start dating. The...shows follow them and two other co-workers, Hanako and Tarou, life in the company and main focus is on Hirotaka and Narumi relationship.My Thoughts:  I'm a big sucker for romance, but what I really enjoyed were the hobbies that the characters were talking about were some of the things I like in real life. I also like the interaction between the two main character since it one cheery person and one kind of like no emotion like person. Yet the one with no emotion wants to release that emotion.Rating time:Plot: The plot, yet simple, is something I like. The environment where we are dealing with adults is a nice fresh of air here. The character being otaku is interesting twist. With that knowledge the common comedy they do with it is great. And the romance is part of the show which is awesome. The rest of it is kind of like a slice of life sort of. I mean they make progression but I enjoy it. 9/10Animation: The anime itself is not ecchi, except maybe for one or two scenes maybe, but overall animation is very nice. The anime is also new from the 2018. The animation shown for different emotions were done great, from cute moments to serious moments to I'm pissed moments lol. They bring in video game references (like RPG have attack escape) which I don't know if it under animation or not, but it cool. They also showed different animation when they were in a different environment. I think they did a really great job on it. 9.5 out of 10.Sound: I watch the anime in Japanese dub and I loved it. The voices were great for the character they were portraying. Even though music wasn't a thing even the opening theme was starting to get stuck in my head lol. Which is pretty big for something that not action pack I guess. I'll give it a 9 out of 10.Characters: The characters are all great. I love their introduction and how you figure out who is what and what do they specialize in. The character past sometimes looked at but not much. The progression is slowly there as well. Overall I would give it a 8 out of 10Overall with Bias: I really enjoyed the anime and the concept what got me. I think my bias is really strong here but oh well. I give this anime a 9 out of 10.Recommendation: I would recommend it. If you like romance and comedy and if you like the concept of otaku and that the character are adult that are working."
"Hot damn, what a good anime.  Just finished my second run through it after about a year and feel like a review is necessary.  Firstly, I'm going to briefly mention what sets it apart from other anime of the same genre.1:  It doesn't take place in a learning institution of any kind.2:  All the characters are working adults.3:  Relationships are established in the first episode.4:  Basically no drama or tension whatsoever.I'm just going to stop there, they've basically committed every sin in the rom-com formula book by violating those 4 principles.  It's a breath of fresh air is...the point I'm trying to make.  Shouldn't be such a rare thing but it is and damn if I don't appreciate the **** out of it.This anime is adorable.  About 90% of the episodes ended with me grinning from ear-to-ear with my heart full of warm fuzzies.   This adorableness is largely due to the fact that this anime doesn't waste screen time on bogus drama and tragedy.  Don't get me wrong.  I like my bogus drama and tragedy.  But this anime says NO to it, Blue Submarine #6 style, and it's a wonderful, beautiful thing.  The focus of almost every episode is essentially to develop teh pre-established relationships.  Since there is no nonsense backstories or dramas to deal with, this anime is able to focus on comedy.  Maybe 2% of the entire anime is like backflash or some kind of explanation for something which is fucking awesome.  Which brings me to my next point of why this is the bees-knees.The characters...  They're grown ass adults and there is very little traditional ""character development"" to be had.  Screen time is dedicated mainly to involving these personas in interesting and fun situations, specifically geared to give you the giggles and the warm fuzzies.You know, I'm just going to stop this review here.  My only complaint about one of the best shows I've seen in awhile is that it was too short and had no conclusion or defining story arc, which honestly might be a good thing.  Definitely got my heart yearning, YEARNING FOR MORE, and I'll be reading the manga for sure.  -1 point for being too short."
"I was happy to watch an anime about and for grown-ups, but it's rather superficial, thus, a wee disappointing.The premise sounds good. It's the perfect anime for people who grew up watching anime and never gave up on their passion. Instead of a school, the setting is a company (though it's unknown what kind of company and who the boss is). Two Otakus who start dating each other, but somehow they never have their breakthrough moment. There's always this air of 'we're dating out of convenience because we're both otakus' and 'well, I do have feelings for her/him' combined with 'we know each other from...middle school'. Yes, both have feelings for each other but...nothing's ever happening. It is kind of a daily-life like 'acchi kocchi', 'lucky star' but for adults. It is entertaining and a good choice for a wee anime binge-watch marathon but I felt like something was missing. I hate to be the one to say it but I just kept feeling that it could've been better."
"A couple of years ago, a drama called ""Nigeru wa Haji daga Yaku ni Tatsu"" (a translation of the Hungarian expression, ""Szégyen a futás, de hasznos"", or ""It's shameful to flee, but it has its uses""; the English title was ""The Full-Time Wife Escapist""), based on a manga by the same title, aired on Japanese television, and became an instant hit for its unorthodox perspective on love and relationships... oh yeah, and Gen Hoshino's ""Koi"" dance that took the Internet by storm.Why do I mention that? The male lead's performance in Wotakoi is a dead ringer for Hoshino's in the same drama: deadpan, at times...caught off guard, but very ""professional"" (even though Hoshino's character wasn't really an otaku). Additionally, the general musical style of the opening theme, ""Fiction"", was similar to Koi (without the erhu; the first five notes of the vocal melody are the same), and the ""seated selfie dance"" (that's why they're doing it one-armed, yo) was similar, if not directly inspired, by the choreography in Escapist. If I didn't know better, I'd say that this is almost a ""pakuri"".The premise has a similar feel as well-- in Escapist a perennial part-timer enters into a contract to be the male lead's wife purely to have a place to stay, and in Wotakoi a diehard fujoshi decides to go out with her gamer otaku friend from childhood largely to form an otaku alliance. Romantic intentions were minimal at the start in both shows.That's about where the similarities end. Naru and Hirotaka have fantastic chemistry from the get-go (and for that matter, Hanako and Taro... Oh no, I just realized the manga artist chose the Japanese equivalent of ""John and Jane Doe"" for the supporting characters' names >< ). Wotakoi is more of a ""what if a couple of otakus started going out"" sitcom rather than ""what if a man and woman marry as contractors"", and so the comedy and situations that evolve are very different.Naru's and Hirotaka's voice actors are unknown to me (I'm sure I've heard them elsewhere, I just don't recognize the names), but they deliver solid performances. The supporting couple is Tomokazu Sugita (well if it isn't Kyon Smith) and Miyuki ""Miyukichi"" Sawashiro. Last time I heard those voices together, they both were bit roles in a hilarious Charlotte scene. Sugita plays the irritable manga otaku office manager effectively, while Miyukichi's lovely alto is a perfect match for the cosplayer Hanako. The character designs are fairly standard fare, and Naru's/Taro's ever-changing facial expressions are some of the funnier running gags of the show.Later in the series we get to see Hirotaka's younger brother, Naoya, and a potential love interest, Ko. Unfortunately it's so late in the series that we'd need to wait for a second series/film before we see anything develop, and credit where it's due, they announced a series 2.A-1 Pictures' animation here is well-planned and executed, which makes me wonder why they accepted such a train wreck last season and slashed story quality in the process. I'm hearing a lot of harsh criticism of the studio itself, which leads me to believe they're just grabbing whatever productions as the lowest bidder. Sometimes it works, often times it's just asking for trouble. So for God's sake, A-1, do NOT use the same writing, production, and planning crew as Grancrest in series 2. Whoever was in charge did not care about the production or the audience, and it showed in spades."
"I really enjoyed the change of pace this anime had, with it being older characters I could relate to them a bit more as they are between 26/28 and I am 24, I did enjoy the more in depth feeling of a relationship this anime gave whilst being light enough that you didn't really have to focus much on whats going on.Its a very easy going anime, the characters are likeable and i'm glad all 4 of them have their own unique nerdiness which means theres someone for everyone!It is still rather wild seeing the differences in cultures and relationships since our 2...main characters are sort of in that beginning stages of dating/relationships so hopefully its expanded more in Season 2!"
"Relationships are always complicated, there is no easy way to deal with them, much less in a world that forces you to maintain a standard of behavior, because, like it or not, the social factor is always one that predisposes our actions to a greater or lesser extent. , which causes a certain mismatch with the things we do with what we really feel.This approach may sound too serious, and perhaps it is, but when you transfer it to such an endearing story, where you can feel identified with every detail, no matter how small, surrounded by an aura of tranquility, but at the same...time It encourages you to reflect on yourself, and rethink many ideas that you have probably had more than once, makes the whole process of learning about love and everything that it entails become even enjoyable.I don't want to sound too romantic, and I'm not trying to be poetic at all, it's just that Wotakoi is one of those series that invites you to enjoy life as it is, without regard, letting your true self out into the world, with the mentality of taking pride in what you are passionate about, as well as hope that there is surely someone out there who feels exactly like you and who is waiting for you, even if that person does not know it yet.Yes, it may be too idealistic a message, but it is one that gives you back a bit of that faith that many of us lost long ago; that gives us back that little shine that we were looking for a long time ago.The moment I started watching Wotakoi, I did it thinking that I would only watch a couple of chapters, but I was starting to do it and not being able to stop. I ended up watching the whole series in a single day, knowing that I cannot afford to do that kind of thing because my day does not give me to do everything I want, however, there was something in me that told me that I had to continue, and when I did, I couldn't be happier about that decision.This is a comedy series, but it has a deeper undertone, one that, as I said, keeps you expectant about the future, about ourselves, and about that special someone who will get to know us more than we do ourselves.It has moments for anyone to feel identified; Of course, this happens to give more variety to the comic gags that the series proposes, but it does not remain as simple, but that same proposal gives us to start thinking and reflecting on what kind of person we really are, and how we relate to the other people around us.At this point, we must be honest, the way we behave with others, whatever the environment, is different from our true ideals, those that are shown to be alone with our thoughts, and it is not a bad thing by itself, but the world, for better or for worse, does not allow us to stay alone forever, it practically repeats over and over again that we open ourselves up to others, and that we enjoy those little moments that are created with the randomness of putting people so different to live with each other.You never know where life will take you, one day you may be quietly reading your favorite book without any kind of responsibility, and the next you are going to work a 12-hour shift to pay the bills for the month; Maybe one day you are playing video games without thinking about anything in particular and the next you are waiting for the bus to go to an important exam, or one day you are simply reading this and the next you find yourself, in the most unexpected way possible, who will be the person who will accompany you until the last of your days enjoying your same hobbies as if that day would never end.I know that I am being very little objective, but Wotakoi is one of those stories that does not allow you to be objective, in fact, it makes you enjoy the complexity in the simplicity, and in how our environment, despite having changed throughout over the years, it can be seen from a perspective as unique as the first time, making you remember what it means to feel really happy, or giving you a reality check to make you feel fulfilled as if you had given back something that you did not know you were missing.This is more than a work of fiction, it is a statement of intent, and for anyone who sees it and can appreciate it, I am sure they will do it at the right time, the one where they need it most."
"Looking for some filler that won't mess with your feelings from that last show you really liked but will give you something to enjoy a bit? Jackpot!!!This one and Net-Juu no Susume both looked similar on my list and I expected something similar out of both. However, Net-Juu was the show I wanted, it had heart, soul, a cutesy story and left a strong, fun, meaningful impression despite its content. Wotaku was about what I expected by the cover art, but I was still hoping for more.The key with this one is enjoying it for what it is without reading to much into the...reality of it. Or if you like to analyze and contemplate things deeply, then the key is to do the exact opposite, but be warned if this is the kind of life you seek, there is no profundity explored in this one, or rather, there is no profundity TO explore.The empty philosophy of the show is pretty sad the more you think about it, so it will really depend on your relation to the characters and your closet-sort-of-otaku level. If you're really diving into deep support of anime and characters, finding your life's meaning in digital self indulgence and merchandise consumption, then this one will leave you feeling justified! Did that line make you happy? If not, you will feel about like you just did while watching this.To be fair, I really liked Nao and that shy character and frankly I thought that was better than the entire rest of the story.The characters are like really composed and pretty versions of those kids who seem a bit lost in fantasy worlds and who generally can't hold regular conversations. I think a lot of people here will have those they have trouble talking to for lack of skill, comfort, or common ground. However, anytime I've met people like this in real life, they were decidedly less amiable. If you tried to game with them they CRUSHED you mercilessly without regard, if you tried to talk to them they could ONLY talk about what they were extremely into at the moment. It seemed like these were the kinds of people the show tried to convey, but I've met them as adults and they aren't like this. At the same time, as a closet nerd for this and that I couldn't relate either. It expected too much of me: I couldn't both suspend my philosophy of life meaning while also trying to accept this fashionable 'otaku' representation as something legitimate.Its one thing to be really into things, its another to be a composed adult, and still another to develop a life of real meaning. Sure they can all relate and intertwine, but the show has this unwritten vibe that a life devoid of meaning is somehow fine and normal. Like these characters NEVER wen't to sleep wondering what the meaning of their life was, if they were wasting their time, if it was all worth it. That whole reality is completely ejected, it just doesn't exist in this world, and thats pretty sad to watch. They never find meaning either, they just sort of team up to indulge their fancies and then thats supposed to be satisfying.I guess my problem with this show is how non-self-aware it is. It really buys its own schtick. The interactions were fun and the show had many laughable moments but the authors apparent lack of understanding regarding why life has meaning and what is actually real and worth pursuing cast a dim tone on it. Naturally those who derive their entire identity and sense of worth from this kind of materialistic meandering might be breathing fire at this point, but thats just it. The void that they are trying to fill that yields the fire breathing upon challenging their worldview is what is missing from this show - I guess you could say its like its soul is gone. Its one thing to get passionate about being a nerd and to talk about the difficulties associating with 'normies' but thats a pretty 'small' plot.Getting along with people who can't relate to your interests or world is difficult, for 12 episodes. I get it, I've experienced it, I still do, this is not the be-all and end-all of life's meaning. The fact that absolutely NOTHING else is ever explored leaves this one in an odd and highly forgettable, if mildly amusing spot. Compare this to something like Yuru Camp which is up to its eyeballs in heart and soul while exploring simple life events and it gives a clear picture of this shows value or lack thereof."
"Super cute Rom-Com that I need at this very moment at time... you know an anime is good when you finish it within a day (even if there was only eleven episodes it stills means something!).Let's get into the anime basics! Story; You meet a girl named Narumi who is starting a new job at a typical office for ""personal reasons"", but little did she know her childhood friend Hirotaka would be working at her new job AND blabber/blather her secret out loud without even thinking about it... that she is an otaku. You follow her and some of the coworkers in the office during...their everyday lives working regular jobs, dinners out together and enjoying otaku hobbies of their days off. Super cute story that any person should be able to enjoy <3 Art; I've always enjoyed the work/animation from A-1 Pictures... the animation is simple, has hilarious expressions and give you ""good anime feels"". Sound; FREAKIN LOVED ""Fiction (フィクション)"" by Sumika, downloaded it right away after hearing it for a second, and then the endings were good! The sound effects were also super cute, and made me want to play video games with the gang. Characters; The main cast was perfect and their personalities matched each-other very well until the very end. I love it when anime's have cute couple pairings!Overall, I enjoyed watching this Otaku lover's Rom-Com. Made me want to play games and watch some more anime with my boyfriend.I'll be picking up this manga series for sure, and I can't wait to see all their relationships develop even more \(oOo)/"
"I don't usually watch romance or slice of life anime series, since I'm more the shounen type. But I don't regret giving this one a try. In fact I absolutely love this anime! The comedy was awesome and this series is so wholesome I'm gonna be farting hearts the next days honestly.Especially one later episode took my heart. I fell so much for the characters and I feel so seen (could relate so much it was amazing) xDIf you're looking for something lighthearted to waste some time, with big comedy, without drama, without big storyline - this one is for you!Hardly recommend ❤️"
"There is very little to criticize about this anime at all except that I wish it were a little longer.To begin with, the story is amazing. It's a romance, but it's not one of those shoujo schoolgirl romances with unnecessary blushfests, multiple misunderstandings, and 'romantic' touches nearing sexual assault. This is a tasteful romance that also forgoes the excessive passion in more erotic and sensual romantic anime/manga where the love is so bright and strong that it's hard to believe it can last like that for any time at all. Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a story about two adult couples with quiet,...mundane love stories. It is responsible, plausible, understated, and strong that gains support in the couple sharing ground and understanding of each other instead of seeking to change each other-- it's a romance of normal people who are just happy the way they are. It's so rare to find such a realistic, mature romantic anime, and I'm so glad that I did. Especially since the plot has so many comedy and otaku elements-- being a certified fangirl, shipper, BL chick, otaku, and otome geek, I enjoyed all the references and found this to be refreshing and so enjoyable I could barely wait for the episode each week.The art was phenomenal. Without making anything overly unrealistic (massive bouncing jello boobs for the chicks, sexy abs when the guys barely even work out, etc.) it just fit into a mundane, every day artstyle. It was clean, colorful, and  was very appealing to the eye. Not to mention the clothing designs (especially for Narumi) were quite adorable! They did a great job with her hair and a lot of the details.I didn't love the opening at first, but it really grew on me, as did the closing. They're not perfect songs or songs I would listen to on my own time, but whenever I hear the first few notes, I will immediately remember the adorable anime this was. :)As mentioned before, the characters were amazing since they were in this mature, realistic romance. They retained enough faults (being addicted to BL/boobs, being angry little jerks, being teases for no good reason, being annoying drunks, getting mad for no good reason, etc.) to seem human, while also being good at things they did. They really seemed like real people, which was pretty great.Overall, this was such a wholesome anime that I just adore it with all my heart. :) I'm praying there's gonna be more of it!I would recommend this if you: like mature romances, like quiet romances without a lot of action, like Kiss Him Not Me, love otaku humorI would NOT recommend this if you: like more 'passionate' romances, like the traditional shoujo romances, can't stand it if the main ship isn't making out most of the time, otaku humor isn't really your favoriteHave great day everyone!"
"Wotakoi is a different kind of romantic comedy show. Most modern romantic comedy shows tend to portray teenagers acting out the many tropes we see in today's stories. The overactive tsundere, the clumsy, well-endowed girl, the male who can't help but stutter around pretty girls due to their inexperience, etc. This show doesn't follow the rom-com playbook. It throws it out the window and completely redefines what the genre can be. It was really enjoyable.Story:The story was very mature. It follows a couple of otaku friends who reunite at their place of work and end up dating. They soon make friends with another otaku couple,...and then the show really hits its stride. This is where the magic happens. The show explores not only the awkward situations that come with being a new couple, but also the awkwardness of sharing a hobby that is shunned by some with others.Art:The art was pretty standard. Nothing too over the top, but definitely precise and on point.Sound:The music wasn't very standout either. It did a good job of adding to the story without actually drawing attention to itself.Character:Easily the best part of the show. The maturity the characters showed was something you just don't see from romantic comedies in anime. The main couple, Narumi and Hirotaka, were really interesting. They took things slowly and grow their relationship in an organic way as they spend more time with each other. Narumi has similar traits to many female protagonists I've seen, but Hirotaka's chill demeanor is different.The other couple, Hanako and Taro, does a great job of helping them along while also continuing along the difficult path of managing their own relationship. This dynamic felt authentic. It was something that comes with having older characters.Enjoyment:I found myself really enjoying this show more than I thought. I can be a little skeptical of romantic comedy anime, but this show gave me hope for the genre. It was funny when it needed to be, and more serious when necessary.Overall:Definitely one of the better rom-coms in modern times. I would absolutely recommend this show to anyone who wants a more mature, realistic take on relationships"
"This was without a single doubt my favorite anime this season. It helps that this was my most anticipated anime of the season. It ALSO helps that I’m caught up on the manga and already love the series. From beginning to end, this was an extremely fun and lovable anime. It was also an amazingly accurate adaptation.Wotakoi follows four adults all working in the same office. All of them happen to be Otaku. Hirotaka is a gaming Otaku, Narumi is a manga/anime Otaku, Kabakura is a manga Otaku, and Koyanagi is Cosplay/BL Otaku. As it turns out, Kabakura and Koyanagi have been dating for...quite some time. Hirotaka and Narumi are actually childhood friends, but haven’t seen each other in years. Soon, they start to date as well.Wotakoi is a romance/slice of life that follows actual working adults. All of these characters are in their 20’s and some have prior dating knowledge. Due to this, there are almost NONE of the common romance troupes. There are no misunderstandings, miscommunications, love triangles, harems, dumb decisions, or anything like that. These are all adults, not drama filled high school students. This was a breath of fresh air. It still manages to be wholesome and adorable as hell at times. Since all of the cast are Otaku, viewers are treated to some genuine Otaku conversations and activities. You can tell they’ve been Otaku for years now and it’s just natural for them at this point. There are a few instances of drama, but even that feels fresh. When two Otaku start to date, they start to wonder if they really do like each other or if one (or both) of them are simply making a compromise with dating someone with similar interests because it’d be easier. I love how a few episodes play with this dynamic and address it appropriately. Since the characters are all adults, they actually stop to talk about this with their partner instead of keeping it bottled inside.The humor is too notch in Wotakoi. While there are plenty of anime, manga, and video game references, the anime doesn’t rely solely on them to be funny. I can appreciate the fact that the references can be noticed by all sorts of anime fans. It’s not limited to certain genres or years.The main things holding back Wotakoi however are all production related. The animation isn’t all that good, but it’s not bad either. It’s somewhere between “Good” and “Adequate.” The soundtrack kind of gets repetitive with the same 2-3 background tracks always playing. At least the OP and ED are phenomenal. This is a critique/comment from someone who’s a huge fan of the manga, but I would’ve loved to see the anime take more chances with anime-only material. It would’ve been nice to see if the studio could make their own moments with the same character dynamics and humor as the manga material. Either way, Wotakoi was truly a gem to watch. I might rewatch it at some point this summer just because of how enjoyable it was. Without a doubt, I’ll be playing the opening theme at least 4 times a week.(Side Note: I doubt we’ll be getting a 2nd season anytime soon. Maybe 3 years from now. The anime basically covered all of the manga chapters. It started relatively recently and it’s a monthly updated manga, so there’s not a lot of material out thus far and it’ll be awhile before enough material for a 2nd season is available.)"
"So, I was never a fan of love stories nor comedy, I found those to be way too cliche and boring. This one, however, caught my interest due to the fact that it was a love story I could relate to; and that any other hardcore anime geek would relate to. I love the dynamic between the couples together and with each other and it just felt wholesome yet really cute. I recommend this to any hardcore anime geek who deep down hopes for a relationship with another geek. This anime even had me longing for a boyfriend who could share my geeky-ass personality.As...for the comedy part: I'm usually not a fan of comedy but this one had my bursting out laughing which actually felt really good. I feel that this could make anyone laugh due to the anime having four different main characters with their own personalities which will make the watcher relate to one or some of them more than the others making their actions enjoyable and even funny at times."
"Wotakoi is a series that will more hit home for viewers who have experience having very close friends or romantic partners who share interests in anything anime, manga, cosplaying, or video games.Story: 6/10I came in with minimum expectations because romantic comedy is a bit iffy in my department and I am not the biggest fan of works by A-1 Pictures.  But for the first half, I found myself amused and laughing genuinely by the hilariously relatable situations of hiding your passions and interests from a society who wholeheartedly tends to think little of those involved in such activities.  It's not unusual for otakus...to initially be ashamed to share their love for anime and manga openly or sometimes becoming socially awkward because it is not a common topic with other people around you.  But it pushes the message that you should never feel ashamed of them and just find people who will accept you for who you are whether you have common interests or not.It's a romantic comedy so there is not necessarily a need for a plot but it felt as it they developed the relationship between Narumi and Hirotaka nicely for 5 episodes in the beginning and then nothing much happens from then.  The comedy became more hit and miss and I wasn't enjoying the episode stories afterwards.  I also am not personally appealed by video game concept episodes so I wasn't intrigued by the RPG portions of the episodes and there were only 2 more episodes after episode 5 where they kept on further developing Narumi and Hirotaka's relationship.  So the story felt very lackluster in the 2nd half.  Not to mention the final episode did not feel like a finale and did not make for a fitting farewell unless they plan a 2nd season.Characters: 7/10Talk about a diverse cast!  A yaoi fangirl, a gamer, a cross-dressing cosplayer, and a moe-loving manga reader.  The characters were very well portrayed in the funny yet serious hardships people can have when they are interested in different subtopics of the otaku industry.  They have their favorites but become very accepting of each others' hobbies which makes for a genuine group of friends that is very enjoyable to witness.  They have their moments when they argue and fight about their differences but they are aware that they all share the struggle of being in the minority in their work industry so they are practically all they have in terms of sharing interests.  The Hirotaka and Narumi relationship was more for starting and developing since they started uncomfortable for being childhood friends and then decided to date.  But their relationship felt real since they slowly became more comfortable with each other and slowly began to learn something new from each other every episode.  Hanako and Tarou's relationship was more real because they have personalities that clash much more volatilely and their devotion to one another despite the constant arguments was cuter and brought upon the most comedy for the time that this anime was good.The story began to take a turn for the worse when Hirotaka's brother was introduced.  Some can defend this saying that there are those who feel left out when their friends or siblings have a hobby they are dedicated to while they have nothing special about them.  I personally could not stand his presence.  The comedy was falling apart when he got introduced and I felt he was more of a nuisance towards the antics of the main cast.  I can see how this could have worked but I was not able to accept him as a useful character and found him more annoying and given more screentime than deserved.Art/Animation: 7/10I don't pay attention to art or animation unless it's grand or horrible so both sections were solid.  But the colors were bright and nice so it was able to stand out and look cute in its own way.Sound: 7/10Nothing that stands out other than those 20 seconds of the opening that is just so adorable!!!  You know what I'm talking about. :)Enjoyment: 5/10This is not a series that will appeal to everyone.  As much as I loved the characters in this series, it felt as if the anime did enough for them to bring me anywhere.  The characters just went on with their lives as soon as Hirotaka and Narumi were settled but I was bored after Hirotaka's brother made his debut.  If a 2nd season ever gets announced, I don't see myself watching it.  The comedy was not strong enough to push the series without a story and that's a problem when the comedy is the center of said series such as this.  The comedy failed and the romance, the stronger the portion, could have been giving more (or better) attention."
"I watched many romance animes in last 5 years. i love this genre. In fact i bored in half of it at first try but after few months i forced myself to end it. I enjoyed a bit. It wasn't half bad. But somehow it kinda felt like watching newbie's creation. As expected Wotaku was author's first piece. And he does both of art and story, probably he gonna make better piece later. This is why i reviewing this anime.Seems like author studied on romance stories bit a lot.It's about of office worker's love story but they're otaku. And there goes love story. If...you watched romance anime a lot, u'd probably bored in middle of it. Just force ur butt and finish it. It may can bore u a bit it's good.Character's art good but background is not good. Also gaming scenes were irate me, that was maybe cute but i really disappointed of that. If someone puts gaming scenes into their piece they should work on them hard. Gaming scenes should be one of main event in this series NOT FILLER!.Op, ed, osts were normal. They should work on them. Voice actresses were good as usual.Hirotaka just pulled this series to better way. In first sight Narumi seemed like b*tch in flashback stories. But it's not reason why i don't like Narumi character side. Maybe she has some good sides but she has to be unique side which one that made him shine. It made her like normal sh*t (btw she may can be otaku but f*ck that that's only base role...). In fact Hirotaka pulled him to shine, lol.Hanako x Tarou was normal cute couple. But felt like filler.If this story continues as anime in sequels Hirotaka's little brother and Kou-chan would make very very cute and good romance story line.Kou's appearance was good. In anime Naoya didn't regonized she's a girl.I enjoyed a bit. But i looking forward to sequel. Hope it goes well."
"This anime was very refreshing. Its storyline is among the most realistic out there which makes it very relatable and having something this relatable makes you soon grow attached to the characters. It covers many aspects of love being difficult for people with special interests. Finding it, maintaining it and growing through it. I also loved how it portrayed the insecurities of not just individuals in a relationship but also of average people in general- how we try to change ourselves to fit an image that is more acceptable in society.Among the few downsides of this anime are:- The similarities in MC names (this...was a personal peeve right from the first episode and confused me as a non-Japanese speaker. This is breaking a basal story rule of not having characters of similar sounding/spelt names in close association)- The boyfriend, girlfriend titles seems to be just a formality at times to provide a connection between two characters even when at times the couple does not behave as so (But you feel this is intentional as the characters don't want to draw unnecessary attention to themselves and honestly it gets better towards the last few episodes)- It gets better towards the end and has promise for the future. It should have been longer or had a second season.- The mature relationship is not portrayed quite accurately. There doesn't seem to be enough going on between the pair to have kept them together 'unmarried' for as many years as is implied.- Its target audience is narrow (enjoyable by those who can relate: various degrees of otakus).More positives:- The animation tries to outdo its own sphere and it's not bad.- The voice actors are perfect for their characters.- The number of true-to-life moments that occur in this anime is very high.- The opening and ending songs lyrically are on point for the story and the tunes as well are quite nice- like someone put the effort in.- There are no tropes being abused here, nor employed. It's just anime characters who are so realistic you just might know someone (or be that someone) who shares their story.- Being such a light-hearted anime while still being deep (with its various devices: dialogue, backstory, solid characters...) and able to elicit various emotions from you at just the right amounts so that it's not drama should be a huge reason for anyone to watch it (if you're an otaku)- It is not swarming with aesthetically perfect characters. Most of them are average looking living average lives.- No melodrama."
"Ah Wotakoi, you were probably my biggest disappointment in the shoujo genre.It all started with a promising ideia, it's not everyday you see a romance story between adults, I know that I haven't seen a lot of those, and instead of showing a different perception of what love means we got a bunch of 25 years old characters acting like teenagers and no development in the main couple relationship, and it doesn't even seems like anyone dates in this at all. Oh, and the jokes were also bad.Besides that, there isn't a lot to say about this no because it's just generic and not funny,...and to be honest it would have been a little less better if the characters were actually teenagers because then their behaviour would make sense and match their age. I also disliked how obsessed all the characters were, I know it was supposed to be the ""funny"" part of this but it just wasn't, if anything it just made it more annoying and was treated like a reason to delay all kind of development."
"Actual Rating: 9.5/10Are you looking for a Romantic Comedy anime that is not cliche in both comedy and romance section? then Wotakoi will be great watch for youMain Good Points- Great OP and ED song.- Great Character Development and Plot that you will certainly enjoy- Relatable experiences that will make you more immerse on the storyNot so Good Points:...- AHHH.... at first i thought the art was weird but what is animation with a great plot right? :)I have watched a lot of romantic comedy already and i am a big fan of such stories. What I liked the most about this anime is that ""it is not pure"". What I mean is that the romantic part is realistic and it shows, at least, a good part of ""mature kind of love and not infatuated"".Furthermore, ""not pure"" and ""mature"" in a sense that characters dont overreact on such jealously or quarrel that destroys relationship.I GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL ENJOY THE SERIES!QUESTION SECTION!:1. What do I like the most on the anime?I like the right timing of comedy and some pinch of love quarrels2. Would you recommend it on somebody who dont watch anime much?Yes! Story is easy to follow and anybody will definitely enjoy the series3. Why you did not give it a 10/10?Well, it is hard to give a 100% 10/10 but I assure you my 9.5/10 is basically 10/10 in terms of enjoyment. ( LOL )"
"I was interested to see how the perspective of otaku’s fit into the working world. I can see the resemblance between the anime and I. The way they convey otaku’s is very standard with their double identity with each character showing their insecurities and fighting through the adult lifestyle which they are adapting to. As we follow the main female protagonist Momose, we can see her quiet persona with a inner conversation about how she cares for each individual liking for anime, games, manga, characters and cosplay events which occur to those otaku fanatics. It is vey appealing and sort of realistic with the same...mentality as an otaku myself. I can say with ease that each person has felt that distance with others who aren’t a fan or who do not understand the different things that are being watched or done because it fits outside of the norm. It is alright, maybe there are traits and character to each person which is represented here in this anime. Although the animation is lacking due to the difficulty developing an anime, and the very limited detailing in certain background and foreground materialistic items, buildings and the overall surrounding makes this anime kind of quirky. Which can be a good thing but with the amazing animation on the characters, this is no exception to the quirkiness of the rest of the animation.With this cut down version of my full review I can say this is a decent anime to watch for those who are lacking in social and ‘normal’ activities that otaku’s need to adapt to. This is the right animation for you."
"A story about relationships bettween otaku.If you like stories about love without the typical trucks of drama that every non-comedy romance show has, this is for you.This show is tagged as both a Comedy and a Romance, although there is a huge emphasis on the latter. I did have a bunch of laughs while watching this, but what sold it for me was how the whole otaku relationship narrative was handled. The characters felt real, and the relationships built bettween them likewise. I really enjoyed this series on its entirety.Also, that opening is awesome.As I think enjoyement is the only score that should ever matter,...I give this anime an 8/10."
"I feel like there was so much flying by through this anime without anything specific ever happening, and I don't know how to write a review for something like that. A 7 is sort of the best I could give it because of how fragmented this series was, even though there were a few parts that I really liked. Much like the anime itself, my opinions about it are all over the place, so let's try and figure out what I think of it:Starting with the bad here, the pacing was so weird. I haven't read the manga, but if this adaptation is faithful, I...gather that it isn't a linear story that's being told but rather smaller stories with the connecting factor being the romance. That kind of structure doesn't really sit well with me because there's never a place to rest and enjoy the series. It feels far too scattered, even if the goal wasn't to create a story but simply show the lives of these characters. But that's the thing: whether it was supposed to be one story or something closer to Kimi to Boku, it didn't succeed in either. It pulled enough of the romance's plot points forward to make me crave a fleshed out story, so it came out feeling choppy instead of episodic. Also choppy was the humor. There were times it worked nicely, but only when it was more traditional anime humor; anything that felt Wotakoi-specific was actually kind of grating to listen to.Speaking of the romance, I don't think I'd agree with the harshest reviews of this anime that say it isn't a romance at all; it definitely is, but it's just not like every other romance anime where the characters take forever to realize they're in love and then take forever to get together. The romance in Wotakoi is almost background noise for how little it's addressed, though it does also have a few moments where it's directly addressed. But those moments aren't the ones that get carried forward. I feel like there were direct statements of a certain character's feelings, like, multiple times throughout this season, and those statements never got addressed. So, even though the romance is there throughout the season, the relationship development of the main couple is so inconsistent it makes it annoying to be invested in them.But there are a few charming points about Wotakoi that kept me watching. The characters, for one thing, got a lot better over time. Again, the humorous aspects were often hit or miss--though I found that that didn't apply to ever character; I felt the boys were much more consistently funny than the girls, which I think is due to the girls' characterization being quite over-the-top and sporadic--but when they hit, they made the most of the characters and the moment itself. The seriousness of the anime increased the longer it went on, which balanced it a lot better and left me satisfied at the end of episodes more often. Adding onto that, when there was actually a proper attempt at romance made, it was done super well. Usually the build-up to them was effective, though I'd say the way the plot used humor to come out of them didn't always work. But it's those moments that makes me want to continue this story in the manga, even if I could give-or-take the rest of the series elements.At the end of the day, I did end up being fond of these characters and how they are when they're around each other, but the main character was far too flat for her to stick out as especially important (which is why I got so excited when she was actually serious in a scene), and the characters weren't quite enough to carry the series for me. Still, it's a decent enough watch if you just want something cute to pass the time with. I don't know if I'll brave the manga or not, but either way, at least I've got this anime off of my PTW list."
"I always try to wait until I finish a show before I write a review, and this one was exceptionally hard to do so! In a season where it has to compete both with the end of Darling in the Franx, and the beginning of Steins;Gate 0, this series still stood out to me as something special.Upfront, I'll admit I have a bias to romances. However, the show uses different techniques, styles, and characterizations that seem to feel familiar while also remaining somewhat grounded. I'll go into mainly the story, the art, and the characters for this review.Story: The show (only having eleven episodes) starts...right off the bat, showing that the season follows Hirotaka and Narumi as they navigate the ups and downs of their newly formed relationship. Unlike most anime with ""childhood friends,"" this one actually shows them being successful in courting their prospective partner accompanied with the aftermath. Rather than simply following their relationship however, it compares and contrasts their relationship with two others in the show. For the sake of spoilers, I'll not mention names. However, the contrasts can show the differences in familiarity, respect, and hobbies that one encounters in any relationship. Although the group of friends all bond of otaku culture, they simultaneously have other hobbies or interests that don't necessarily overlap. The show uses this to represent how just because a couple shares a common bond, doesn't mean they need to necessarily be the same person. The three relationships shown are thoughtful, insightful, and show us fears and insecurities just as much as the ups.Art: The art style for this show focuses much less on beautiful visuals and animations, and much more on small otaku or video game references. Even in the final episode, I was seeing other anime referenced in the background almost fully on display, as if to advertise it. While at first I thought it was distracting, I feel they actually were trying to bring a sense of depth and atmosphere to places outside of the workplace, the most common setting for the majority of the show. I think that the flares for the dramatic the art style had such as RPG popup menus, robotic voices, and background references went a long way in developing a style all on its own.Characters: Finally, the best and brightest part of this show is the character developments. For a relationship show, I don't know if I could find another that actually follows the ups and downs of a relationship without trying to be as depressing as ""Scum's Wish"". The insecurities these characters have feel realistic, and while they might not be worrying about the infidelity of their partner, they might be wondering ""am I good enough?"" One of the most basic human fears, not being worth someone's time. Past that, characters don't immediately appear lovey dovey, but you can see and feel the affections the characters hold. They're used to each other, they're familiar to each other, thus things like kisses, sexual situations, and dates are handled with a mature mindset that can be hard to find in many anime.Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii bring a lot to the table in terms of character and story. Personally, if Darling in the Franxx or Steins;Gate 0 weren't airing this season it would probably be my anime of the season. Overall, I believe this show is worth your time, and I'll be holding out for a season 2."
"Similar to Net-juu no Susume, the show consists of a slightly older cast of characters; we follow the lives of small group of otaku in their mid to late 20’s. Wotakoi is unique, though, in that it begins where most other romantic dramadies typically end—with our protagonists actually in a relationship.It’s apparent that there wasn’t too much of a budget to work with here, but they get along well enough via cost/time cutting measures like shot selections that don’t require a whole lot of actual animation.Wotakoi is not the prettiest or most comical show in the world, but it is endearing in its own way....This is a good one either wind down or wake up with. You’ll chuckle a couple of times, you maybe even hold your breath once or twice during a surprising moment of suspense, and ultimately, you’ll feel good watching it."
"so this is my first proper romance anime. other anime I have watched did have romance in them but it wasn't their main focus. as a fist romance anime i got to say i selected an amazing anime to watch.I love the intro and only skipped it twice. I normally skip intros to speed things up but I love the song and the rest of it. the anime keeps itself well grounded and doesn't go into some absurd stuff. I think Narumi is pretty awesome. nice and sweet but also serious and angry at times XD the other characters were really nice but i think...Narumi is my favorite out of them.this anime had me laughing at times and I really enjoyed those moments. from subtle humor to the way their faces were expressed made me laugh. an example would be when Narumi and Hanako are talking about boys love stuff with Hirotaka and tarou. while i felt uncomfortable listening to this conversation i was laughing at how crazy serious the two were taking this.overall loved this anime. only thing i would change would make Hirotaka a little more expressive, not by much just a small bit."
"Good romantic comedy anime titles are hard to come by nowadays, and many of them that I have seen recently are derivative, cliched, and overall not romantic or funny in the slightest. Then I saw the teaser poster and the trailer for Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii, and read up on the premise, and it seemed like something interesting. The first episode eventually came out, and I was struck by how fresh, funny, and unpretentious the show was. I genuinely enjoyed the episode, and it maintained that quality throughout the other 10 episodes. The writing was clever and sharp, and the characters were relatable. Overall,...I really like this show, and is one of the best in the genre in recent years."
"When you think tokimeki is over after you graduate from high school, here comes wotakoi! a very nice anime that encourage otaku/weeabs out there  to get a job. In my opinion personally, using an office work environment setting in an Anime is quite unique, since not much anime have taken that kind of setting and not only that, this anime describes how love workout for otaku out there, so it is quite funny, you know what to expect when two otakus become a couple. This anime is an unique romcom, I really recommend this Anime for those who love romance comedy and light show...to watch in your leisure time, this anime will put a smile on your face, your heart racing, and rise up the hope on tokimeki that maybe you have given up since you graduated from your high schooll."
"A slice-of-life romcom that started off as a comic on the Japanese online artists community Pixiv before being serialised as a web comic. 26 year old Narumi Momose seems like your average optimistic cheery girl but she has a secret. She doesn't want anyone to find out she's an Otaku (geek) because guys always dump her when they find out she's also a ""Fujoshi [rotting girl, word play that refers to women/girls]"" - a girl who is into ""Boys Love (explicitly illustrated fiction featuring gay men relations)"". After her last boyfriend left her, she decided to start afresh at a new company and tries to...keep her Otaku nature a secret but she soon finds out she wasn't the only Otaku there. Her childhood friend Hirotaka Nifuji who isn't a fairly socialable gaming Otaku also happened to be working there and there was also fellow Fujoshi, Hinako Koyanagi who cosplays as male characters and was a fan of her self-published BL. Hinako's rash, angry looking but considerate boyfriend Tarou Kabakura is also a bit of an Otaku too but hardly shows it.As Narumi and Hirotaka catch up she reveals how she doesn't have any luck with guys. She never makes a mistake in dating sim games so she doesn't understand why it never works out but, doesn't want to date an Otaku who might be more accepting of her because she considers them disgusting. However, when Hirotaka points out he can be really accepting of her Otaku habits and always be with her like in an RPG, Narumi decides to give him a chance. And so, a new relation begins for the new Otaku couple but as they hang out together with Hinako and Tarou, they feel like something's not quite right.When you think of an Anime about Otaku you'd probably think of classics like Genshiken but this show feels quite different. Probably it's set pass the stage of uni clubs and right into working adulthood. It's a cute show with an opening that features a dance with fun hand gestures. Narumi has cute expressions and it's always entertaining when she's trying to help people around her. It's fun watching the couples get caught up in each other's little fights or just supporting each other too. Geeks watching this will probably be able to relate a lot to the show right away. It's filled with emoji since Hirotaka isn't very good at expressing himself. There's even features footage from Monster Hunter X on the Switch.Actually, you'll see a lot of product placements in it, no parodies like the usual Anime and lots of references to other Anime shows like Macross, Evangelion, One Punch Man and Maison Ikkoku. Part of the fun is recognising them all so unless you've seen a lot of shows or played a lot of games then you'll probably miss a lot of the references. Some of them are actual phrases that were pretty much lost in translation with the subtitles I was watching such as Hanako saying ""yoroshii, naraba krieg da [Then krieg is what you shall have]"". This meant she was declaring war but is also a reference to a line used in Hellsing when a 13 page speech was given in the Manga - in other words, a fierce argument ahead.There's also a fair bit of Otaku lingo too which is interpreted fine but you kind of miss out on the fun lingo - a bit like the time when Densha Otoko was released and there had to be a glossary. Best one for me was probably ""imakita sangyo"" - short for ""I just got here, please summarise what's been going on"" on 2ch forum.There's nothing too explicit in this show but since it stars two Fujoshis, there are times you hear and visually see what they're fantasising about men in gay relationships so you might not like it if you're a guy. Thankfully they rarely occur - I've only seen it happen once in the entire series. Show looks great, nice clean art like most of A-1 Pictures slice-of-life shows and the music's mostly cheery too.So if you're not bothered by the odd Fujoshi fantasy going wild, it's mostly a straight cute romcom that isn't overly mushy. Don't miss out on the extra scenes after the ending. The show just gets better as it progresses.Looking forward to a season two!"
"I really love the character development from the start all the way till the last episode. There were moment when I couldn't stop laughing. it's not like your typical romance anime that you see where they don't kiss till the last episode. I love how they aren't shy about what they love. They really connect with each other. The anime intro is so cute and funny itself. To sum it up this is a romantic, slice of life, comedic, gaming, action anime. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON PLEASE CONTINUE WITH THE SERIOUS!!!! >.>Also this isn't your typical lovey dovey romance anime."
"I don't normally watch slice of life animes like these but I was pleasantly surprised with how amused I was. The characters, despite being office workers were realistically whimsical and it was fun to see their relationship dynamics in and out of work. There was also a sprinkling of otaku references throughout the season which I found to be a refreshing delight. As a romance anime, the characters were thoroughly written and were able to express emotion to a realistic dimension.I would recommend this to older audiences (such as myself) as it might be a bit more relatable, and thus, enjoyable."
"So, let me preface this by saying I have never been a fan of 'Slice of life' anime. I've tried a couple but ive never been able to get into them.Story 5/10 - There wasn't really a story to follow, it seemed there was going to be in the first episode or two but then it just didn't materialise at all.Art 9/10 - Ok the art was lovely in this anime, from characters, to food, to scenery, it was all fantastic, there's no complaints from me in this department.Sound 7/10 - Nothing out of the ordinary, VA's were great.Character 7/10 - I feel like...they did a good job making the characters different enough and unique, however, there was only really 4 characters in the whole anime so I can't give it better than a 7.Enjoyment 6/10 - There wasn't quite enough comedy for me, the romance wasn't teased much or set up well, it just sort of happened. I was fighting through from episode 4 and succumbed in episode 7.Overall 7/10 - I didn't want to be too strict as I believe the problem lies with me and not with the anime. I am not a slice of life fan, this anime had many good points but I just couldn't keep my interest up."
"If you want to feel butterflies and sigh wishing you were the main character, this ones for you! I've been looking for so long for an anime like this and Ive finally found it. All i can say is that I did enjoy this show despite it being so short.*Stuff i think couldved been improved with the story:First major problem I had though is development. There was, it did exist, but its too small of a development. In my opinion there should've been more progress between the two characters, thats what made the anime lack.Second is the secondary main couple, Hana and Kabakura. They...may be funny but their relationship makes me concerned. I feel like if you remove the veil of comedy, their relationship would make you worry. There's bursts of sweetness here and there, but if this kind of relationship existed in real life it wouldn't last for long. The first thing that comes to mind to Kabakura when asked what he liked about her is big boobs, seriously?Third, the background, world-building. It feels like a mess. I feel as if there was no proper build-up. Hirotakas confession(?) wouldve been more romantic if there was proper backstories and foreshadowing. Also that one episode where the two male leads drank with their coworkers, why didnt they just admit they were the boyfriends then? There's a lot of things that weren't properly explainedFourth. The fact that they would often call others beautiful and look at them differently despite being in a relationship. Its always made me uncomfortable. Kabakura compliments Narumi jokingly and shit like that, Narumi even once stared too much at the barista whom she did not know was Hirotakas brother... like yeah I get it, being attracted isnt bad, but shouldnt you limit yourself with that when youre in a relationship?Thats all. Aside from those I had lots of fangirling moments"
"It's nice to see an office romance between adults instead of your typical high school drama. While common in live action romantic comedies, it's not a setting you find very often in anime. The fact that the main girl is a closet otaku/fujoshi is just icing on the cake.I love Narumi trying to hide her power level only to get outed by Hirotaka on her first day. Then it turns out that every other person they work with is some kind of otaku or another. Narumi writes BL, Hanako cosplays, Hirotaka is a gamer and Tarou is the resident lolicon. I like that many different...facets of otaku culture are all represented, and in a pretty authentic way. It's not like western ""nerd"" shows where they take every opportunity to remind you, oh boy these guys are nerds look at how nerdy they are. It just shows the hobbies of these office workers and how they're still normal people.My favorite pairing is the little brother and the reverse trap. It's cute how innocent he is and how much he wants to learn about gaming so he can better understand her. It's all the funny of him being gay with all the hetero a God-fearing Christian like myself can wholly support. All the romance in this show is delightfully wholesome and drama-free. It's a fun watch and an easy 8/10"
"Wotakoi was a pretty simple anime in general, but just because it was a romantic relantioship between two otakus, it made the thing much funnier and it made me quite interested in the story (more than I already was to start it, of course). Both of them look really different from each other even if they are otakus and the reason to start this relationship made things interesting. A lot really. I had so much fun watching it. It's something I would like to watch again with someone special, even more if the person like anime as well. It's a simple slice of life but...it can be cool. I'm not really bothered by anything in this anime. It's simple in general, nothing extremely special. The very nice thing is all under the fact of who are the protagonists for me. They're fun and cute together."
"If I were to describe ""Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii - Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku "" in one word, it would be PERFECT.This show was a bomb of laughter, emotions, and drama, which is the perfect recipe for a successful rom-com anime, and it managed to present it wonderfully.Characters: The main cast is excellent, Narumi was my favorite but also Hanako was right there too.Sound: Flawless, The OP and ED are top-notch.Art: Outstanding, A-1 Pictures really did a good job working on this show....In conclusion, it was an enjoyable show, highly recommended for those who want to escape from reality and enjoy a heart-warming anime. 10/10 undoubtedly."
"Wotakoi is alright. If you want an anime with likable characters and wholesome scenes, this is probably a good anime for you.There's basically no story, but that's fine. This is an episodic anime, creating enjoyment solely through the small cast of 4 characters.The art is incredibly average, but it's not the highlight of the show so that's alright.The opening and ending are nice, but the background music and sound effects are also incredibly average.The characters are the main selling point. If you don't like these characters, then you won't like this anime. Most of their personalities are unoriginal, but it's through the interactions between these...characters that most of the enjoyment comes from. There's also the endless amount of references to service any viewer that happened to have recognized them. There is a little bit of character development with each of the characters, as we see their relationships grow. This is especially evident in episode 10(?) as we see Hirotoka's and Momose's first hug. It's a little subtle and somewhat minimal, but each character seems to be able to understand the other more and more as the ""story"" progresses.I enjoyed a good amount of the show. Sometimes I was a little bored with some overused jokes here and there, but overall I had a good time.All in all, Wotakoi is a show carried by the characters and humor. There isn't an epic story or incredible fight scenes, but it's still enjoyable."
"Love is Hard for Otaku isn't my typical anime. I was recommended this by a friend and figured I'd try it. I just want to preface this with the statement that I don't find a lot of appeal with anime centered around romance.Now that being said, this is not your typical anime centered around romance. This is an anime about romances between Otakus. As someone who enjoys anime and could easily be categorized as various kinds of Otaku, I can say that this definitely had some good references to Otaku's life and culture, mostly to positive comedic effects.It is pretty good at this...comedic aspect, and the art is solid. Definitely some meme-worthy humor overall. However, there is next to no plot. While I understand it's a romance anime and that's not the focus, I would be amiss in not pointing that out.Overall, if you are an Otaku (and let's face it, if you are reading my rather mediocre review of an anime titled: ""Love is Hard for Otaku"" you definitely are,) then you will probably get a kick out of this. I can't testify to whether the romantic parts are of good quality or not because I don't watch enough of it, but it didn't seem noticeably bad."
"To sum up - almost every episode is a slice of life, otaku double date.The thing I enjoyed most about the series was the references to otaku culture, anime, manga, games etc. I also found the relationship dynamics quite amusing at times. Most of my enjoyment from the series was definitely the relatability and otaku references. I also liked the aesthetics and the setting.Unfortunately I felt that the story as a whole was lacking. There was barely any structure to the entire series never mind individual episodes, and there was little to no character development for any of the cast individually or as couples....I went into the anime expecting (and hoping) for more of a romcom experience, however there wasn't enough of either romance or comedy to be able to class it as such. For me, the humour purely came from the relatability and real-life references so if you're somehow on MyAnimeList but don't know much about otaku culture then you're probably not going to get much out of this series.Words I'd use to describe the series overall: felt unfinished, lacking structure, little character development, little romance, unique presentation, fun real-life references, humorous otaku culture references, slice of life, uneventful, chilled.Overall I enjoyed the series but I probably wouldn't re-watch. 6/10."
Great Animevery relatable for most of us because you know most otakus have trouble finding/falling in love with normies cause they have different likes and personalities and this anime shows that kind of reality that most of us are in and this anime showed every single kind of otakus and how they handle their daily lives living among normies that will judge or avoid them like Momose's past relationships. and how they simply don't care about others' opinions about them like Hirotaka's personality. overall I really enjoyed it and I have fun watching this type of series I highly recommend it for Romantic Comedy watchers...out there.
"AHHH! This was such a cute laid back anime that was the perfect length when I needed a break from them long ass shonen animes that are 100+ episodes. This was a really cute anime with wholesome characters that actually made me laugh quite a bit :) soundtrack is meh, but characters r cute and fun to watch grow hehe I think the aspect of childhood friends and being otakus was a cute blend and I really appreciated the relationship and how it was chill. BUT THEN WHEN MAH BOI HANAKO MADE HIS MOVE AHHHHH... there were a lot of cute moments that actually had...me smiling ear to ear lol"
"Story: The Story was really simple. Just a couple of childhood friends who rekindle a friendship at work which ends up resulting in a relationship. Along with another couple who they work with the anime follows the daily lvies of these four Otaku and the struggles of dating an Otaku.Art and Animation: Very clear, clean, and crisp. This anime was very easy on the eyes. With A-1 producing it I did not expect anything less.Sound and Music: The opening is probably the best of the season. the song is super catchy and you basically just want to get up and dance with the characters. The...music throughout the series is not really noticeable which is not a bad thing. The voice actors did a tremendous job.Characters: The broke down the dynamic of anime fans pretty well minus our two female leads. They were even able to work in a ""Non-Otaku"" to make it feel more real in my eyes.You have your two fujoshi fan girls in Narumi and Koyonagi who at most times disagreed with who they ""ship"" in certain series.Narumi you find out right away is a Doujinshi Artist.Koyonagi's hobby gets found out pretty quickly as well, as we find out she is a popular cosplayer. I would have liked if the anime went more into these two and their hobbies but they did enough in my eyes for how the anime turned out.We then have Hirotaka who has a more laid back and chilled personality and focuses his time on games. IE the game Otaku. He and Narumi are dating.Then have Kabukura who is the boss at the office that they all work at. He is dating Koyonagi.Kabukura is basically your average Otaku. He prefers Yuri manga and anime. His clashes with Koyonagi can be pretty funny at times. There are some serious moments between them as well which really make the anime feel more realistic.Bringing back the ""Non-Otaku"" we come to find out about Hirotaka's younger brother Naoya. Naoya works at a local coffee shop near the office that our main characters work at. He has absolutely no skills when it comes to playing video games or when it comes to watching anime. They even refer to him as a ""Normie"" in the anime which I found pretty funny.He eventually meet Kou Sakuragi a classmate of his and they form a friendship over a PC game.I was kind of upset that Kou was introduced so late because I liked the character a lot.Enjoyment: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I though the comedy was really well done and I love it when an anime makes references to other anime.Overall: I thought this was one of the best anime in Spring 2018. However this anime is not for everyone. I feel like it's more for people who can relate being an Otaku. There's just certain references I feel like most anime watchers would not understand.If you are looking for a great comedy though I would recommend it."
"Wotakoi is a situational comedy for people who enjoy the anime flavor of things. We get to follow two couples around as they work, go have a drink and attend comicon events. The main protagonists in this tale are Nifuji and Momose. Nifuji is an inconspicuous and self-contained gamer. Momose is a fujoshi and manga artist. They start a relationship, seemly out of convenience at first. Despite what the titles implies, their relationship is not hard on them by any means. In fact they get along pretty well.The same cannot be said about the second couple, formed by Konayagi, a cosplayer fanatic and Kabakura,...a YuriYuri fan and apparently a figure collector (he talks about it a couple of times but we never get to see his collection, which is a bummer to be honest). They often have theatrical arguments over non-life-threatening things like Kabakura not wanting to cosplay as a girl or his refusal to read BL manga. Of course they always manage to overcome their differences and everything ends up being fine, because this is a feel good show.Talking about feeling good, the comedic sketches here are rarely funny, they're mostly amusing, built for 'feel good' purposes, though occasionally there's a chuckle here and there to be taken. Unlike with the manga, the show doesn't have that many references to otaku culture as the title might suggest. The show revolves a lot more around Momose and Nifuji getting used to be in a relationship on one side, and Konayagi and Kabakura fighting and making amends, on the other. A couple episodes have a lot of references to gaming, a couple others have some manga and anime references but it's mostly a superficial thing that doesn't have to be there for the stories to work out.This is the perfect palat cleanser for when you finish watching something with a lot of earth threatening monsters, androids fighting aliens, mechas, and teenagers that can fly and destroy buildings with a single punch. The romance is subtle and sparingly used, the characters are likable, distinct and wholesome. I just wish there was more otaku things on Wotakoi. I still can't get over the fact we never get to see the figures hoarded by Kabakura."
"A great slice of life anime for young working adults.  Hits the feels, gets the laughs, does its job!Objectively, if I were to say anything bad about this anime, the art and animation can sometimes leave some things to be desired, but I feel as though those things don't matter too much in a comedic anime such as this one.  I could say the same about the sound design, not including the voice acting.  Voice acting was great, and the performances mixed with the writing and the visual comedy kept this anime propelling forward even if there might be little to...no actual plot.I loved this anime and it really resonated with me.  It was just what I needed at the time of watching! 8/10"
"The manga is one of my current top favourites, and when I heard it'll be adapted into an anime, I was nervous because I have high expectations naturally. Luckily I'm not disappointed thus far! It definitely doesn't look like a low budget anime adaptation (like Orange, ahem).I like WotaKoi for the slice-of-life, josei storyline and the characters are interesting yet believable. The story sticks very closely to its main theme of love and friendship between working adults. I like the pace of the story's development, it's subtle rather than dramatic and has an easygoing, effortless feeling to it, which is a lot more realistic...and a breath of fresh air from dramatic incidents. This show is meant for the viewer to kick back and enjoy it for how it resonates with the viewer's daily life and hobbies. I can confirm this, because I'm also an otaku somewhat. ^^The art is really close to the manga and the colour palette tastefully chosen (thank god there). Sound-wise, there's nothing much to shout about but it's understandable because of the type of story and setting (vs historical epics or sci-fi fantasies, for example). The ED song is quite catchy. I do like how pauses are employed to enhance the dead-pan humour in certain scenes, plus the robotic narration is hilarious and a pretty smart replacement to the original manga's footnotes.I just finished ep7 before writing this, so I hope the rest of the episodes will be just as enjoyable. This is good entertainment, especially if you are a working adult otaku!"
"An anime about a workplace surrounding four otaku like adults seems like a pretty good choice to watch, to consider that most of us are either still working while focusing on our game like hobbies, or we’re probably just underemployed waiting to see if we can get hired again. It also says a whole lot that these four characters in this show can make working in an office like workplace seem like the most interesting place to be productive in.Narumi and Hirotaka didn’t seem like to be type in the relationship at first, since Narumi wanted to hide her fujoshi like lifestyle from him. Meanwhile,...the surprising relationship between Koyanagi and Kabakura was probably my favorite on the show, considering that Koyanagi was the one that was into Kabakura trying on cosplay and yaoi for some reason. However, I do there was a second season where Hirotaka’s brother, Naoya, and Kō would explored a whole lot more since they did seem like the best example of opposites attract. It was beginning to be my second favorite relationship on this show.All in all, a surprising hilarious and heartfelt comedy where sometimes even when you do reach young adulthood, there are some things that you love that do not always go away. Also, I do appreciate the Monster Hunter references on this show, since the famous JRPG really does have a way to get people forming both friendly and in the case of Naoya and Hirotaka, familial relationships. It’s a great pairing."
"SPOILERSWotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii: This anime lets just get right to the chase is pretty generic. Its pretty much just one of those humble cute anime that you binge on a rainy day. Its a partial comedy slice of life with a impactful 11 episodes. This anime came out spring of 2018 which makes it reletively new. Essentially its about a girl who gets a new job in a new city in japan. Shes a closet Otaku who loves anime and even creates Yaoi hentai on the low. She goes to her new job and end up meeting an old friend from middle school...who used to game with a lot.  This dudes like a super Otaku who games at any time he can. They end up catching up and becoming friends with each other, Also it turns out 2 other people who happen to be a couple are also otakus so they all basically become friends. The dude and the girl start to date because like damn why the fuck not. Anyway its basically a cute little story that will not dissapoint if you have nothing else to watch. Also the opening is literally one of the greatest i have ever listened to and seen i swear if u see this opening watch the animation it is so cute you will die not to mention the song is so good easily my top 10 ops. This song for capturing what it seeks to capture gets a solid 7.5/10 because its funny its cute and has a nice opening but I would not call it impactful or like hilarious like love is war or Konosuba. Nonetheless its a great show and if u have nothing else to do I suggest you check it out :<3 7.5/10"
Just watched the last episode!I started watching it pretty much after reading the synopsis. Animes with otakus are fun to watch for me. Especially because while watching it at times I think thatsss sooo meee! xD Wotakoi didnt dissapoint me.In Wotakoi we follow the story of 4 otaku friends. But whats really refreshing about it isss they are not in highschool but already in their late 20s and working!The characters are all different and that makes it interesting. Hirotaka is a hardcore otaku kinda xD but he is also very cute. He defenetely wants to show his affection but sometimes its hard since Narumi...sees him more like a friend and misunderstands things he does.I enjoyed watching it. And the opening music suits the anime quite well.^^Now my overeall score is 7 for the simple reason that since the MCs are adults and this is a romance anime you might asume that you see more relationship stuff happening than in highschool animes. But no... Ofcourse there were romantic moments and really cute ones that is but just not enough. I wanted to see more romance going on. And a lil bit more character developement. And also there was one little thing left open in the last episode :PSo thats why I didnt give an 8. But Wotakoi was fun to watch and the story was simple but nice.^^
"It's cute and different (being a story about otakus) but you can get bored very fast. It's not intense in a typical sense. Usually the thrill of romcom animes is the build-up or the tension in the air lets say but I don't get the same feeling from it. The main dude feels like a robot at time yeah, there is a lack of expression that makes him feel unrealistic at times. It's pretty mediocre. Also, in some scenes you can definitely tell that the animation budget for this was quite low or rushed as there are a few seconds total in the episodes where...a frame is kept still for longer then needed."
"""New workplace, new me. I won't let anyone find out that I am a hopeless otaku! Yes, I have changed my wallpaper to something normal."" No, this is not you but our shujinkō(主人公) Momose Narumi who is a fujoshi or a yaoi fangirl.This story is about a girl who doesn't want her colleagues to find out that she is into BL even after becoming a part of working society. The twist is ,of course, when she mistakenly bumps into her childhood friend, Nifuji Hirotaka, who knows about her ""hobby"" in the same workplace.""First mission assignment, silence Hirotaka."" And of course our Hirotaka is dense and...emotionless which is opposite to Momose's personality.The story develops into something more interesting in each episode and slowly they find other colleagues with same type of hobbies. They interact and become friendly enough to talk about it.The story progression is somewhat special because rather than character development, what's more observable is that the characters are opening up to eachother which in my opinion isn't character development. Pacing of story is not to fast or too slow but isn't exactly comfortable either. It's something difficult to explain the pacing so watch for yourself to understand it.The character setting is really fantastic. First, we have Nifuji, a game otaku.Next, we have a fudanshi(though he never refers to himself as that in whole series), the guy who loves Yuri, Kabakura Tarou.And lastly, a comrade of Momose, who's also into BL and a cosplayer, Koyanagi Hanako.The best part about this character setting could be seen in later episodes when other people from workplace were shown and their views about them.For me Kabakura-senpai was simply the best not because he and I share the same interest but because his VA is Sugita Tomokazu. Sugita-san is also VA of Gintoki.The animation was what would be expected but it wasn't anything notable. Could say it was decent. The representation was somewhat appreciable since there were a lot of references from famous anime and to games both directly and also in background so look out for them in anime. I especially loved the scenes where they would play online games and their game avatars would look like them.Special MentionI truly liked the character Nifuji Naoya, younger brother of Hirotaka. His presence itself was heartwarming and his VA was just as amazing as the character.This was my first office anime so I am not sure if I will find something better than this in genre but I truly enjoyed it and don't think it will change in future.All in all, I really enjoyed watching this and would totally recommend you to watch this especially otakus who are contributing to society."
"I stumbled upon Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashi in my search for my first romance anime that deviated from using drama or comedy as a cause for infatuation between characters. Because frankly, watching so many relationships start from dramatic events or simply because ""why not"" felt like a tiresome repeating event after a while. After a while, I thought ""Man, these people have no actual common interests shared between them, just plot induced drama, this relationship ain't gonna actually last"". And in being in a relationship myself and being ""forced"" to see thing from a different perspective, very little anime had hit that spot of...relatability that I longed for. The age difference of the characters of this anime compared to everything else I saw was a good enough promise that this anime what what I wanted to see.There are two main differences that makes this anime stand out and they are fairly simple ones. The age of the characters and the focus on a different part of the relationship other than the ""leading up to it"". We have 4 characters split into two couples, all in their mid-late 20s, working office jobs. One couple is still in its infancy and the other which while not stated, is going on for about 8-9 years minimum. Already, feels pretty fresh compared to most others. And the show capitalizes on that by focusing mostly on these two couples and their interactions. (There is a third couple developing, but since it wasn't fully realized it wont be mentioned. It's a shame, as I feel, it was a real wasted opportunity to add a third party of a younger relationship-to-be still trying to figure stuff out ALONGSIDE the others would have had a nice contrast).Character wise, splitting the cast again by couples, we have care-free Narumi and silent Hirotoka, and on the other side we have the two headstrong Hanako and Kabakura. As if by MERE CHANCE, the two personalities are made to be complete opposites while the other two to mirror each other (at least, it's what it seems at first). They all have the ""otaku lifestyle"" as a common denominator, though the show goes out of its way to prove that even that isn't a simple tag you can put on someone and instantly say you are a match. Again, deliberate choices in my opinion to flesh out these otherwise stale tropes of typical otaku. While on the subject of characters specifically, I wanna focus on Hirotoka, as he is given a lot more backstory and character motivation. While this could have been a hinderance to the show and its tone, I feel personally that it is done beautifully. Despite what he may give off in the beginning (silent, cool, maybe boring and predictable main protagonist), he is what I would describe as a near perfect representation of the type of character he is trying to represent. Not awkward, easily flustered or anti social man, but just a person that is less outward emotionally. He is still very proactive, even more than the Narumi at first, being the one to make the first move and the one to try and address the problems that begin to arise. He genuinely cares and tries for the relationship in his own way. And the backstory he is given just adds a lot onto that and, in my opinion, make him very relatable, more so than other characters of his type in anime. I'd honestly rank him as one of my favorite anime characters (not really a big list but STILL). I don't wanna get too much more into it, since spoiling more would spoil a lot of the show and its great character moments.Broadening the scope again, the great moments don't stop there. Since the show is slice of life, it jumps from one character interaction to the next and they are for the most part solid. I guess, you could say that it has it easy, not having to build an actual story, but I have yet to see many anime hit that same note of relatability in some aspects of relationships. Focusing on the more mature couple to begin with, I have seen many people just describe it as toxic. Obviously they have had little experience in what relationship actually are. We are talking about two people who 've know each other from high school and stayed together till present day while working at the same job on top of that. Merely imaging how hard that would be gives me chills. I guess many have only seen cute moments of relationships as reference, but in reality, being in one, especially for that long, you are going to be subject to a lot of fighting even about trivial things. Things like wanting to share some more interests of the other person (even somewhat forcefully), just spending quality time together, or even wondering if all this time together was spent for nothing and the other person simply tolerated you for this long. I have never seen an anime (again to be clear, that is a very short list) portray these problems before. And it's because you can actually see all these bad times, that the sweet moments hit all the better. Jumping to the newer couple, the anime takes very much the same steps to feel real and relatable. Questioning what the other person is actually thinking, since you 've yet to know him well, comparing with previous relationships, having a hard time figuring how to spend quality time together after wearing down the one thing that connected you. Even having awkward intimate moments (more than once with no ""ok we got it now"" the next second), and it is played more for the real moment it is rather than just a joke. Things like worry, jealousy, awkwardness even fear is present in all characters regardless of their personality. It's honestly really refreshing to see.Looking to the more technical production side of things, animation and music. Truthfully, there is nothing to right about. Animation is mediocre with no really amazing shots and visual comedy through smart animation is kept at a minimum. Music, other than that damn catchy opening, is again nothing to write home about. I barely noticed the music and going back to actually pay attention to it, I wasn't really impressed. As always, it's a really shame to see, especially in the music department, but I didn't feel like it hurt the show, so I am just going to leave it at that.I left this last part for...last.. because it's more of a personal thing (MORE SO THAN THE REST OF THIS REVIEW, I guess). I didn't start watching this show because of the otaku couples, it wasn't what personally drove me to watch it. And many mentioned anime characters, I had to google, and many reference mentioned probably flew over my head. It was more of an ""cute couples do cute things"" ™ show for me. The common interest was just that, an interest the characters shared. Compared to them, I d probably be considered a ""Naoya"". And I feel like that's completely fine. For me, it was more about the couples than the common interest they had and the show I feel does try to nudge you into that direction, showing how even they, had trouble agreeing on things or sharing the more specific aspects of ""being nerdy"". Going through the recommendations for this show, most people choose to associate this show with others mostly with otaku relationships. Personally, I do not think that this is the main selling point of this anime and it's rather than a hook to get more people to see it.To leave with an ending note, I really liked like the show. I rated it higher than many others on my list because of how relatable and fresh it felt. Many others probably will not feel this way or might enjoy this show for some other respectable reasons. Either way, I feel like it's a rather underrated little anime, that most should watch to get a more real, but still ""cute and fluffy"" view of what relationships entail."
"Honestly when I was younger in life and I found myself watching this anime it didn't really make a connection with me. I just thought it was boring, but watching it now as I've matured in my anime taste and having my understanding of what a bad and good anime is, I've realised now how amazingly good this anime is. I like how the character grow closer together at there own pace. I've watched countless rom-coms and the way most of them have the character kissing and almost doing the deed by the end of 12ep is kinda cringe and over sexualised. Like sure it...works out for some anime but it feels too rushy and I dislike it. Now that being said if its too long then it's kind of a bummer.Now I know many people would go and say this was boring well I would say there flawed in the views. I feel like you really need to come in watching this with a good type of mindset. The mindset of a realistic human, like most of the time these days people rush things like get married to soon and then break up. But instead if you really took the time to get to know the person and not have to rely on borderline sexual activity's to boost the connect with them.Sure its nice to have physical contact every so often but that's not what makes a relationship work. Its being there for each other, having that trust, that bond and being able to have fun no matter what you see as fun as long as your having fun. That's what I'd say this anime did a spectacular job at doing and its a good breather from a lot of other media shows (anime and regular main steam media) where they feel like its necessary to have sexual scenes, like me as a 20 year adult I just find myself skipping more and more of those kissing/sexual scenes, I just find it boring and awkward and its not always needed, YES there are times for them but its not what makes a rom-com exciting for me.ALSO the ova was great too so go watch that if you haven't. I just wish they put out more seasons. I'm probably going to read the manga if there is one."
"The story is very mediocre. Not a whole lot happens throughout the anime and they don't really change much. They introduced new characters throughout the anime, drawing away time from the main 2 characters Narumi and Hirotaka which I found annoying.  I do wish it was longer or the focus was much more on Narumi and Hirotaka's relationship, but I suppose this anime isn't so much for me then.Narumi and Hirotaka had the most elaborate characters, and their backstories are the best, yet they didn't dwell on it and half of the screen time was on other characters.When the story starts getting good,...the anime ends, kind of disappointing really.However it is very easy to watch so I can't complain too much.Art style is good, it's my preferred style of art. Good voice acting. Yada yada yada"
"Wotakoi ~an unexpected little diamond~It was 1am and I couldn't sleep. So I decided to watch anime.Wotakoi (with only 11 episodes) was a pleasant surprise.It is a very nice show with warm atmosphere and humour. In some of the episodes they refere to famous anime and mangas and, so, I felt more familiar, like I was part of their friends group and we discussed together. All the protagonists have the same love: anime but they are also really different: the bl reader, the gamer, the cosplayer etc. You will definitely identify with one of them!The 4, different types of otaku interact and understand thatLOVE IS...HARD FOR OTAKU!"
"I loved it! :DIt was a breath of fresh air for me. I saw a clip of this on Tiktok, got curious so decided to watch it.My curiosity led me to something worth watching. It was very entertaining and the humor always got me.This is also something that I can relate to since they are tackling adult life already and they are geeks in their own way.I love all the characters, but my personal favorites are Koyanagi and Kabakura. This couple adds spice to the series, through their endless bickering in front of others and contradicting likes.But despite that, they have...""adorable moments"".To sum it up, this anime is on my fave list."
"I've been watching a lot of Shonen these days and wanted a change. Therefore, I looked for some wholesome romance and comedy. Wotakoi is exactly this.Without a coherent plot(as the opening says), you can pretty much jump into any episode and enjoy it. I in fact did this when I accidentally watched EP10 after EP1. Wotakoi is a bunch of fun stories to get absorbed into. I usually don't like episodic shows, but Wotakoi nailed it from start to finish.‎The characters and their dynamics are super fun. I loved the contrast between Hana and Kabakura's relationship and Hirotaka and Momose's. They all have distinct personalities...and enjoy different otaku things. which creates many fun moments.‎ Hirotaka is undoubtedly my favorite character, maybe because he is really the only one that got any characterization beyond his hobbies and appearance. I'm disappointed we couldn't see just a bit more from him tho, feels like wasted potential.It handled its romance in a great way, and it was super refreshing to see adult romance instead of high school teens. No one getting all red all the time and misunderstandings get resolved on the spot, instead of the characters not talking to each other for a week. I'll admit that Hana and Kabakura's relationship had me questioning whether it's healthy at times, but eventually, they got a ""redemption arc.""Wotakoi will make you feel warm and lovesick. Whenever the main characters had a tender moment, you would catch me smiling ear to ear and daydreaming.One thing that can be weird about Wotakoi is the two leading female characters imagining Yaoi with their boyfriends. Tho I guess this isn't out of the ordinary for fans of this genre.The art and music were great, that opening is iconic! I especially enjoyed the backgrounds, so kudos to whoever worked on them. The fun little things they did to make the anime seem like an interactive game made me laugh so much while watching. And the, as I like calling them, ""ID cards"" they showed during the ad breaks were yet another creative decision. The animation was mind-blowing for a romcom, and the opening alone can show you that. Gotta thank the hardworking people at A1 Pictures for that.Wotakoi is fun, romantic, and wholesome. It made me laugh with splendid comedy, that felt natural. Who would have thought a show about office romance between otakus can be so endearing? I heartily recommend it.‎"
"Are you new to anime ? Planning to get started? Then THIS is the one for you.It’s a simple and sweet and very enjoyable. You have characters to love and bonds to gush about. Best of all, its fricking HILARIOUS. Couldn’t have been more glad to choose this anime to start with.Animation wise it was a satisfactory. What got me best was all the chibi moments and the dramatic parts that just made this more enjoyable to watch episode after episode.LOVED THE OP. It’s catchy, its fun and the little hand dance!!! The whole sequel was gold and I will always cherish the moments I...took binge-ing this anime.A solid 8.5/10 for its storyline, ease of watching and overall performance.I recommend this, incase this review didn’t make it obvious enough. Mostly for those starting with anime and need something simple. Also to the romance fans and those who enjoy a digestive slice of life.In the meantime, do check out the manga. It’s equally good and even has some great extensions to the anime :)"
"Sad that it did not live up to the promise of the title. Descended into a workplace romcom with trivial otaku references. Ignored the promising material of exploring the con scene, aspiring artists & writers all while holding day jobs. I can see lots more interesting plots that could be done. Dress-up Darling was much better and recommended over this.The negotiation between Koyanagi & Kabakura of their contrasting interests would have been fun to watch & the side plot of Nifuji Naoya & Sakuragi Ko felt more like filler.Loved the intro though. The animation for it is quite endearing.Unfortunately I haven't read the manga and...can't compare it with the source material."
"Story - 7Let's start with the pros. First off, this story is very relatable to the average otaku (or just straight up geek). The setting is also unique and gives a charm to the show since it is one of the few I've seen outside of a school settings. As well, this was extremely captivating. However, there is only one downside. The story is more episodic, but the cons are outnumbered by the various pros.Art - 9Starting with the intro visuals, they were colorful, impressive, and fun... very fun. The dance in the opening is addictive and fun (as I said), I caught myself practicing...what they do every single episode. Throughout the show, the animation is consistent without any major complaints. The references to other shows (such as the JoJO's reference) adds to the charm and mood of the show. Also, the ""isekai"" episodes gave a fun twist and contrast to the usual animation. The only minor complaint I have about the animation are the 3D crowd scenes. In the backgrounds the people have 3D walking animations and it's a tiny bit weird. It wasn't bad enough to knock the art down to a 8 or 7 though.Sound - 10No complaints. The voice acting was so so so good. Simple as that. There is no voice in English that could compete with the Japanese voice actors. The intro and outro music, outstanding, I even added it to my playlist after the first episode. The rest of the OST was catchy and vibey. Perfection.Character - 9The 4 main characters are well written and relatable (as I mentioned before). Out of the 4 main characters you have to relate to at least one of them in some major way. IF you're an otaku/geek the characters will make a lot more sense (meaning don't watch this as a normie/with normies). However, Nao was not it. I wasn't a very big fan to be honest. He kinda ruined the vibe being a normie and a college student, since the rest of the cast were adults. A final minor complaint, was how for the majority of the show, the characters rarely changed color schemes.Enjoyment - 10Even though there were slight flaws, this show was so hype and mood lifting. The comedy and sarcasm throughout the entire show was great. The side couple, Hana and Kabakura, were definitely the comedic highlights of the show. Nifuji was a solo comedian, and it made it even better that he wasn't purposely being funny. The intro got me boppin everytime, caught myself dancing, and singing. I want more. This is the first solely romance based anime I've wanted more of. Dark, horror, and psychological is usually my taste, however this shed a new light on romance that I never had before.Overall - 9Overall I highly recommend this to any otakus. Up till now it is the best romance I've seen. You WILL learn the dance. Enjoy :)"
"This anime is quite interesting. i enjoy it. This anime focuses on the romance between otaku and gamers and otaku and otaku. with an interesting comedy and a light storyline that makes this anime interesting. but the lack of conflict makes it a little boring. because usually romance-comedy has a little conflict.Animated no doubt, A1 pictures are very good. I like the opening part. indeed this studio is good at making openings. and others that I like when Hirotaka plays online games, the game graphics are shown as in the original 3D game.I didn't expect much and didn't expect a season 2, but if it...does, I'll watch it. I watch anime is just for entertainment, so I just enjoy watching anime like Wotaku, without badmouthing an anime. I can't give more reviews, if you are curious about this anime, please watch it for yourself."
"As being a nerd.. and still am, this anime was enjoyable... but moving on to the actual review this show has so many mixed feelings for me personally...!Story - (4/10)The story, starts of really great, I enjoyed everything, and the ""nerd"" genre was used fairly and it did not feel too dragged out... well until later at least. Like, you see, this anime at some point started to feel too re-used and boring at the same point, and the ""nerd"" genre started to feel FLAT OUT, they did not even use the ""nerd"" genre, and rather ""i just want a good life"" trope instead,...and just covered it up with the term ""nerd"" thats straight out what the story is all about...Charecters (7/10)The charecters are great, fairly well devoleped, I would have given it a 9 if they werent wasted and were one dimensional by the middle of the show, but I have no probs with them they were still one-dimensional enjoyable charecters ig, and Harako and Nao-chan made this selection a lot more better since she and him were the most intresting and has so much good scenes but the rest of the cast ESPEICALLY Narumi and Nifuji failed itAnimation (7/10)I really liked the animation of the actual charecters, especially when they are zoomed in, since they have high details, and A-1 did a great job, but the problem is the backround, the backround is too pale and boring, and it's not attravtive at all!!Enjoyment (5/10)After the first 5 episodes, all I wanted to do was finish it and I wasent intrested at all the intruguing things were faded already...Potential (8/10)It had a strong start, and I wanted to put this anime as one of my favorites since it was really relatable to me as a decent nerd lol but yeah it failed itExecution(2/10)Far by the worst catagory, they throwed away what they had and made it a rom-com even though it was they throwed away potential for rom-coms too, teasing us by a hint of kissing, barely showed what happens to the couples later on and much moreOverall (7/10)"
"spoiler free!!!t's  objectively a seven yet for me personally it was an eight. I find myself being a romance anime hater AND an adulthood hater, but this anime kind of changed my perception of those  two things. I enjoyed it so much.The characters are great, they (and the plot) are the best example of amazing simplicity. Even though the main character is a classic outgoing pink ish girl, she's not one to hate. I found kabakura and koyanagi to be the best ones, but the love story between hirotaka and narumi is cute. i feel like even though this anime is weirdly...cringe and lightweight, it shows the awkward and realistic parts of a relationship while still being cute.The bad parts are that it gets a little boring sometimes and that the two main girls are fujoshis. they overuse the word otaku and it's honestly very cringe from time to time. but i loved it.It makes you strangely happy, like a comfort anime. this is the first romance anime i ever actually enjoyed, and i hope i can see more like this.(edit): i actually saw more like it!! horimiya and ao haru ride. they're awesome."
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a simple anime, but very fun and cute, I really liked this anime. If you're looking for something relaxed, but cute and funny, I really recommend watching it. This anime changed my life, I am super happy to have watched it, I thank those who recommended me and recommend it if you haven't watched it yet. <3 Characters are really funny, each with its well-defined characteristics, although animation is not one of the best things, the story itself is perfectly good in my belief, moreover the anime's mood is incredible!Otakus identify with humor, whereas not only for their...personality, but also for their attitudes, thoughts and tastes, I find this very interesting"
"The story is relatable in some ways. The MC was just not the good at first, but the character development came in and I'm actually enjoying this. IT's so good that they we're able to make an anime like this. You don't find anime's like this nowadays. Hoping for the second season to be released this year. Reading the manga already and i like their development so far. Kind of refreshing to see something new as this. Hoping to get a satisfying ending for this anime. There are times that my heart is just racing towards the MC to confess in a hard passion but...he said that he wanted it be something where Narumi would not be able to forget. Too realistic too but some are just too good to be true though."
"This anime made me laugh SO hard because I could relate to the characters! Narumi was literally the cutest, while Hirotaka was cool, calm and absolutely attractive. I love a romantic comedy anime that isn't plot-heavy and delivers a light, humorous relationship between the characters, so I found myself loving this anime so much, that I overlooked the OP and some of the background music.I think there could have been a bit more of a meaningful connection between Narumi and Hirotaka because it really just felt like two friends forcing each other to date sometimes. However, I'd say the anime adaptation is a lot...better at capturing moments that the manga was unable to, such as certain movements and the way the characters feel and talk, which is why I'd give this a 9/10."
"I watched this anime because the opening was very catchy lol. I thought it would be a meh series, but I actually really enjoyed it. Despise all the characters being otaku they all show it in different ways, making all the episodes dynamic and funny. It was really refreshing that the protagonists were adults instead of teenagers. The principal couples of the series were interesting. My favorite ones are Koyanagi and Kabakura (I'm a sucker for love/hate couples lol). Narumi and Hirotaka are great as well, but I didn't feel them as a couple until the last chapters. I don't have a certain opinion of...Kou and Naoya because I think their development it's more shown in the OVA that I haven't watched yet. Talking about animation and art style, it's not dazzling, but it works perfectly. I really like the text boxes referring to RPG games and the chibi part. In conclusion, if you're looking for a funny and easy to watch with lots of references to otaku culture, you should definitely give it a shot ヽ(>∀<☆)ノ"
"This anime really took me out for a good ride not a big roll coaster but a nice steady smooth one. I really did enjoy the scenes of how their relationships took place and progressing on why they are meant for each other. I really don't have a lot of complaints to say bout this anime but I really did enjoy it a lot. TO ME this is one of the best romantic/comedy in my list. It shows romance but also stuff that can happen in real life (slice of life). It also doesn't show any disappointments just them living their lives like a regular...couple do. Well for a otaku lol.Hope they make another season coming up, I would really want to know more about Hirotaka and Narumi relationship since it doesn't show a lot only a glimpse when they were younger. Also the other couples are cute too. Basically both of the couples are dope. All in all its my favorite.ALSO I LOVE THE OPENING it's goddam catchy and cute."
"very enjoable, should get a second season, worth to watch if you like wholesome kinda slowpaste romcoms. Would like to see more development in the characters but thats why it should get a second season.It had a nice start and introdouced the characters well throughout the story, and it had a nice slice of life vibe to it.Its a good story with something new to it, the working enviorment vibe and personal life of the characters, and you see some development, which only makes the story and characters more enjoyabale.The intro is catchy and its easy to get interested in the story and characters almost...right away."
"This isn't a romance anime in the traditional shoujo sense. Although their lives are revolved around otaku culture, this is a more ""mature"" romance portrayed in a fun. Hirotaka and Narumi don't take themselves too seriously, unless it's otaku related, which is fun to watch. Of course there are a few ""serious"" moments between the two, but I think the charming point of this anime is that it's not super serious. I was constantly laughing throughout the anime. I know some people don't like that there wasn't an overwhelming amount of PDA between either couple, but I personally had no problem with it. There were...a few times where I was screaming for Hirotaka to grab Narumi's hand or for Kabakura to pop the question to Hana, but I think that's what also makes the anime realistic. Not every couple is super lovey-dovey like shoujo animes portray. Some couples start off slow and build up to it and that's Hirotaka and Narumi. This anime doesn't necessarily have a ""point"" to the plot, but not all anime need one to be fun to watch. This anime was cute, funny, and very enjoyable to watch overall!"
"This is a great anime.This is not your typical romance shojo anime, this is something the young adult professional can relate to. From the daily grind to the nighttime xp grinding, you'll probably see a lot of yourself in one or more of these characters.The plot feels fresh, as instead of the usual ""chase"" that leads up to the typical confession, the main couples of the series are both already together very early on, and it's more about the slow and steady development of their relationships, like real life!What you'll get watching this show is seeing many cute and funny scenes, but also the...MCs struggle with insecurities and emotions, having to confront their partners about these in subtle ways. It feels very real and raw.The art and sound are good, nothing special.Overall this is a really great show that defies tropes and expectations."
"WotaKoi : Love is Hard for Otaku is a good romance comedy. I really enjoyed this anime. It was very wholesome and I laughed a lot about the jokes. The characters are well written and they all have their own personality, what I really like because that is very important for all kind of shows. Also the drawings are one of my favorite and the sounds fit good to the scenes.The only this I missed was a good plot. The story did not have a real detailed plot and that is what I really love if I watch a anime. The two main characters are...childhood friends who are gonna date but there is more a friendly relationship than a love relationship. I was also a little bit dissapointed at the last episode because there is not a real ending. I don't know if there is gonna be a season 2 (I really hope there is gonna be a season 2) but if there is going to be a season 2, I will definitly watch it and I hope it gets more plot."
"This was a very cute, funny and short anime to watch. It wasn't the best but definitely enjoyable if you're looking for something to snack on. I love the simple concept where two otakus fall in love and that her friends/coworkers also like similar things, but can also accept each other's different tastes. And the thing that made me the show likeable is the number of easter eggs and many relatable scenarios for us anime/game/cosplay nerds out there.Despite all these good things however, thats pretty much all there is to it. Some of the romantic scenes felt pretty underwhelming and it felt like half...of the show simply wanted to focus more on the nerd and spend way less time on the characters' development. I'm glad to see everyone's backstory, but I also want to see more of how the character grow with each other. But then again this season only had 11 episodes and based on the ending and the ""mattane"", I'm assuming and hoping that there will be a second season. However, since it is now 2020, I'm not expecting too much. SOI guess I'll go read the manga~"
"Ok ok, maybe I'm biased. But let me start my review by saying this: I don't give away 10 stars so easily. I'm actually very picky. Most of my 10s are from a few shows from my childhood (nostalgia is a thing that affects all of us, don't you deny it!) and some are from shows that I actually, legitimately, truly loved.And boy oh boy, did I reeeeaaaally love Wotakoi.While it doesn't exactly have a linear plot (I guess it follows more of a ""slice of life episodic"" formula), the cast more than makes up for it. We have a fujoshi that doesn't want her...secret to come out to normies, a hardcore gamer who doesn't care what other people think of him 'cause he's pretty much antisocial, a cosplayer who's also a fujoshi and who mostly cosplays as male characters and a mild otaku who's not that into the weird spectrum of ""otakuness"" [except for lolis and yuri. he's VERY MUCH into that.]And those are just the 4 main characters, I could spoil a bit and talk about the others but I'll let you watch it and meet them yourselves instead ;)So. These four work together in a firm and become really close friends and THAT'S where the story really begins. Two of them were already dating but the other two start dating at the beginning of the story and it's really cute and funny to compare these two couples and see how different their dynamics is.This anime deals with the awkwardness of being an otaku and trying to date with someone who is/isn't a part of your circle of interest. It deals with the friendships that you can find if only you open up a little bit and show other people your interests and see what their interests are like, too. It deals with light themes (""haha wouldn't it be funny if our boyfriends fucked each other? BUT MY BOYFRIEND IS TOTALLY A TOP! YOURS IS A BOTTOM!"") and dark themes (""hmm i think i'm gonna get my ears pierced just so I can get the attention of my childhood friend who I have this major crush on""). And so on...True, it does deliver more comedy than romance. If you're looking for kissing, romantic confessions and such... hmmm... maybe this isn't exactly the anime for you. But it will definitely melt your heart and put a smile on your face, for sure.Another downside is that it's so SHORT. Only 11 episodes, 23 minutes each. But even so, I think it's a sweet, short ride that's worth getting on."
"Girl, DTMFA and find someone better  - he's either got diagnosable intimacy/social anxiety issues you can't help him with or is just asexual. Either way you can do better and find someone who will fulfill you romantically and sexually and who you will not have to mother as a way of gaining any sort of attention or intimacy.People praise this for featuring adults, these are not adults. They act like platonic friends and not even particularly close ones. In any other romcom the main guy would be the villain, the romantically useless boring guy the main character realises she needs to dump because he...can fulfill none of her needs emotionally or sexually.I initially quite liked it, 6 out of 10 and quite watchable if nothing special. However in episode 10 I realised I'd completely misread the situation. I assumed when at the end of the first or second episode she stayed over and they were in pajamas in bed and there was an awkward accident that led to a kiss. I assumed that broke the ice and after that they had sex and it was behind closed doors but broadly they were having sex. I mean she's staying over in his room loads in this show. I didn't realise when they said sleepover they meant sleepover like teenagers have, I assumed it was a euphemism. They are in their late 20s!But oh no. The big thing in episode 11 is he goes to hold her hand for the first time after months of dating, and wimps out.I though cause japan and manga can be a bit funny about sex in certain publications you definitely have to read between the lines and broadly it's going on but just not part of the story. Nope. He's lusted after this girl since he was a teenager, they are going out for months and he's still not properly kissed her."
"English.I think that the word to describe this anime is: ""Meh"", I think that the concept that it shows us of love between people who like geeky things is quite interesting, but its realization sins of being boring and of not fully delving into its characters .The story is very simple and I think that the development of the couples is not completely specified, in addition to being a bit mediocre, since the two couples shown (later three) do not feel like true couples, the first of the blue-haired one with the one of Rosa feels like a friendship relationship more than anything else, the...second one of the orange-haired girl and the green-haired girl keep fighting throughout the anime for no really logical reason, then there comes a point where you don't believe them to be couple although sometimes they can behave as such.The story is episodic and we don't have a specific objective in all the anime, that means that you only watch the episodes to see them and don't give them so much importance, I think if you like this type of anime you'll love this one, If not, I don't think it's necessary or I don't recommend that you see it, there are better alternatives in the love genre and with the same geek theme.Español.Creo que la palabra para describir este anime es: “Meh”, creo que el concepto que nos muestra del amor entre personas que les gusta las cosas geeks es bastante interesante pero su realización peca de ser aburrida y de no profundizar por completo en sus personajes.La historia es muy simple y creo que el desarrollo de las parejas no se concreto por completo además de ser un poco mediocre, ya que las dos parejas mostradas (posteriormente tres) no se sienten como verdaderas parejas la primera del de pelo azul con la de rosa se siente como una relación de amistad más que otra cosa, la segunda del de pelo naranja y la chica de pelo verde se la pasan peleando en todo el anime sin algún motivo verdaderamente lógico, entonces llega un punto en que no les crees que sean pareja aunque a veces se pueden comportar como tal.La historia es episódica y no tenemos un objetivo en concreto en todo el anime, eso hace que solo veas los episodios por verlos y que no les tomes tanta importancia a estos, creo que si te gustan este tipo de animes te va a encantar este, sino creo que no es necesario o no te recomiendo que lo veas, hay mejores alternativas en el género de amor y con la misma temática de geeks."
"Growing up from a kid to adulthood, I’m sure all of us has our own favorite hobbies, interests, or dirty little secret. Not many people like to admit it but it’s part of our society and how we live in. For a show about the otaku culture and exploring the lifestyle of the nerd norm, Wotake ni Koi wa Muzukashii really set the bar high. Welcome to a world where office romance, otakuism, and gaming culture become an experience you won’t forget.The English translation title is “It’s Difficult to Love an Otaku” and “Love is Hard of Otaku”. Literally, those words mushed up together already...feels like the show is a big joke or satire. While the show seems like it’s taking a risk at mixing a variety of questionable gimmicks together, I can say safely that there’s no need to worry. As a fan of the manga, I was thrilled to learn that Noitamina was chosen to air this show. It seems fitting for such an anime based on their history of lineups. What’s more is that this show also portrays a more realistic slice of life story that you don’t see too often these days. To me, this was a God-sent gift for Spring 2018.I’m not going to lie. Watching this anime reminds me of being a kid despite the show being targeted at an older audience. The goofy style of the storytelling along with the colorful character cast brings in a very playful atmosphere. Even as the show takes place in an office life environment, it’s hard to ignore the character chemistry between the main cast. From the start, we got two childhood friends named Narumi Momose and Hirotaka Nifuji. The two have known each other for awhile but are almost like complete polar opposites. Narumi is a bubbly outgoing girl with an interest in fujoshi and otome games. On the other hand, Nifuji is an otaku with an avid interest in video games and doesn’t actually seem to care what other thinks of him. Despite their different personalities, it’s undeniable that the two has chemistry both during and off work. The other two lovebirds in the show consists of Hanako Koanagi and Tarou Kabakura. They are dating as a couple and while the two constantly bickers at every chance they get, the two genuinely seems to love each other. Now, you’re probably thinking…is this going to be a show filled with drama and misunderstandings? Absolutely not. While the show contains office romance, it’s hardly a story that focuses on that exclusively. Instead, this anime stands out as a way of exploring the everyday adventures of these characters.One of the primary factors that makes this show appealing is the small character cast. It capitalizes on giving every character a chance to shine without leaving another in the dust. The couple pair of Narumi and Nifuji is infectiously entertaining to watch. Their character chemistry is shown through their interests that somehow intersects with their daily lives. At the office, the two maintains a professional relationship although they still act casually towards each other. The show explores their relationship development as they understand each other more in their adult lives. This even includes going on dates to the movies or amusement park. While the show adapts their relationship more as a ship tease, I think it’s safe that fans accepts them as a couple. Hanako and Tarou are dating already so the show doesn’t hide the fact that they care for each other. It’s mostly lighthearted romance that relies more on realism to do the storytelling. Office romance isn’t easy to adapt but this anime does that without ever being distracting. Characters act the way humans do while drawing connection to their otaku interests. Each of the main characters has their own interest. (otome games, gamer, cosplaying, bishoujo) As a central theme of the show, it establishes their interest through dialogues, interactions, and references. The show often throws in jokes with characters’ small talk and arguing to sell its comedy. It’s damn entertaining as every character gets their moment of fame. It masterfully matches the pacing of the dialogues that feels very real. The impression those moments bring is an accurate depiction of how co-workers behave. Whenever this nerdy group goes out for a drink, they act like casual adults enjoying life. It brings in the sensation of a rom-com between working adults that leaves me satisfied. Oh and before I forget to mention, give the manga a try too. The anime actually expands on some background content but the manga also feels like its own little world.To be honest, A-1 Pictures is the last studio I would imagine adapting this show. However, the production quality itself is vibrant with colorful character designs. The characters looks distinct between one another with their different hair colors and facial expressions. Character reactions also sell a good deal of the comedy especially whenever Narumi reacts in exaggerated manners. As an anime that focuses on otaku, do expect video game references to be made such as the Nintendo Switch and Monster Hunter. There’s even one episode where the characters are adapted into an RPG setting with very gimmicky video game themes.No fan service? No problem. You have the character dialogues doing the talking and most of it delivers humor in the most harmless ways. Yet at the same time, it’s able to create quality entertainment thanks to the talents of the voice cast. Narumi and Hanako in particular are able to bring out the best out of characters through that with their human personalities. The theme songs are also quite creative with their choreography. Namely, the OP song “Fiction” by Sumika is adorably cute with the body language. Every character in the theme songs stands out with their coordinated movements.With 11 episodes, it felt just enough for this anime to do what it’s intended and that’s to sell its ideas to the audience. It succeeds that thanks to its creative circle of characters and their interests. Otakuism is not something that’s accepted easily as a positive culture norm. In fact, it’s often looked down upon in our society. However, this show presented that in a positive way. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the show is recommendable to just about anyone. A show like this deserves more attention, seriously."
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi for short) is a romance comedy which characters are Otakus (Anime or Game Otakus). It is set in an office setting, featuring 4 main characters (2 couples) that are dating each other. Here in there, you would see direct references to manga, anime, games, and the likes. However, this anime fails to deliver well in both comedy and romance. I think it is important for you to treat this more as a slice of life show featuring otaku couples, as to not give any unmet expectations.The romance in this anime is more of just a setting as it is...hardly explored. It will only occasionally throw in some romantic moments. Meanwhile, the jokes in this anime are rarely funny. I feel like the biggest problem to the comedy is the awful timing. It is really slow at delivering punchlines, making it unfunny at most times. To make it worse, there are sometimes short explanations by the game-sounding-narrator, which further slows down the pace.The characters here are not really outstanding. There's no traits or moments that I feel really stand out from them. Also, even though the couples' relationships might change a little, the characters themselves hardly changes.The background music is one problem I have with this anime. Maybe it's just not my taste, but although there are some good tracks, there are a lot of weird tracks that are just slapped unto an unfitting scene (honestly, I don't think those tracks could fit anywhere).Overall, I think this anime fails to deliver a good romcom. There is only a little romance development and jokes fall flat. This is an anime for watching the daily lives of otaku couples. And that's it, since the only thing this anime got going for it is its relatability for people familiar with the otaku culture."
"I picked up Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii along with 3D Kanojo together back when the show first aired and expected both to be about the same, I gave the former an 8 and the latter a 7 originally if my memory doesn't fail me, and from then on even though both featured otaku (now it's obvious that 3D Kanojo only has one while Wotakoi has it's entire casts as the same but I picked it up together for the same reason) it became clear as day which was fresh garbage and which was the anime that made me dance. Looking at the rating I...think you know what show turned out to be the one that made me dance, yes. This is my review of Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii, ikuze!!!Let's start with some backstory. My last seasonal romance watch was in Summer of 2017, almost exactly three seasons ago, which is shocking because if you know me, I love romance and always strive to watch it in some way or the other but in terms of seasonals I felt tired and stopped focusing on the genre. To reasons obvious to romance fans I felt Spring would be the best season for a romance fan to return to the seasonal genre and found a lot of romance anime to watch, but none, absolutely none made me fall over them as much as I fell over Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii. Not because it's cute, but because it's unique, it's fun, and of course, it's got everything else going for it.I mean, look at it's competition this season (or even the last), what romance anime did we have? Tada-kun started strong but suffered with it's cliche problem shortly after, FranXX continues to be complete garbage in the romance category (and dare I say it every other category), the anime I formerly mentioned, 3D Kanojo almost immediately disappointed me with it's second episode, Grancrest had the same FranXX situation, while Beatless could be considered one slot better than the two mentioned. Leaving us with two romance anime this season that continued to be adored by me, Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii and Akkun To Kanojo. The latter was and still is an enjoyable show but being a short, it can't compare to Wotakoi in the same breath. Why? Read on!First off, it's a fantastic slice of life anime. Wotakoi is how you make a Slice of Life Romance work and I can't find any other examples that bettered it till Winter 2017 (when I first started seasonals) and overall I'm sure it'll rank up in my top 5. Yet again you ask why? Because it knows how to captivate it's watchers with warmth. This brings us to the question, why do we watch romance anime? Many would say that it's because it brings them warmth, and surprise, surprise, Wotakoi gives you that. A cute, warm and fuzzy slice of life anime you can cosy up to whether you're single or with your partner. Even though it's centered on Otakus, it's biggest feature is that there's something for everyone.Everyone will find something in the anime worth relating to and laughing at, and I'm just talking about the normies here, if you're a mild anime watcher or a hardcore one, both parties will find lots and lots to laugh at and references to gloss over with this anime. Be it a Dragon Quest reference, a Final Fantasy reference, a Saekano reference, etc etc. There's lots to list and I don't have enough time to list them all for we must move on to the next best part. The soundtrack. I don't think I need to tell you how popular the Opening is especially with it's dance and there's been countless videos on YouTube (some of which were taken down because Sony Music) showing viewers how the dance is done or how they reacted to this marvelous choreography. And that's not to mention the ED as well. Fantastic, cosy and just a joy to watch, it's an excellent example of a testament to the anime.And we've barely scratched the surface. What else makes the anime so fun? The biggest reason why? THE CHARACTERS! I haven't seen such vibrant AND relatable characters in an anime in a very long time and this was just fabulous. I mean, it makes me wanna write on every character. First off, we didn't get one pairup, we got TWO. Then the interactions, motivations, situations, all made for a really cute yet not over the top anime. It didn't overstep its bounds yet created an environment that only Wotakoi could create and excel in. This isn't a Utopia, this is real life, and the real life says Wotakoi is excellent. Speaking of real life, the wonderful staff who worked on this anime. Having renowned VAs like Sawashiro Miyuki and the legendary Sugita Tomokazu himself, this anime wasn't at all short of talent, and the others too did brilliantly. I never for once felt like the voice actors did a bad job, or that the directing or scripting was bad in any way.I might be sounding like I'm fanboying like crazy but let's just say Wotakoi IS that kind of show. It makes you warm and you're left beaming with happiness. Definitely something I'd call a feel-good show. Oh and, another reason why the anime is so amazing? It's got adults. Not high school kids as the main characters and that gives a LOT of room for different scenarios and even though our lovely cast might seem childish, in the first place, being an otaku is a throwback to childhood anyway. And second, we don't have any blushing game of random meetups and random kisses and random blushes and random etc like most high school anime (I already triggered the FranXX fanboys, don't want another group to come after me so I won't give examples now) because from the very first episode itself, everyone is dating. Yes. You read that right. They're dating from the first episode itself and they're adults and they're Otakus. Reasons enough for why it's so fantastic?Still not convinced? How about I tell you that in spite of having such a unique setup, it handles it excellently? Convinced? I sure do hope you are, because I still have more to say. I haven't even gone to the characters in detail yet! Hirotaka might seem like your dense that you see in most high school romance but NO. Do not underestimate him because he is sharp. I mean, the ending of episode 1 changed my view of him from the get go. Surprised? I was too! He continued to be brilliant like the rest of the cast. Narumi on the other hand is fortunately not a flat female character (I just love making that pun) as we see in some romance anime and much like Hirotaka, is just a joy to watch. She's cute, relatable, and is a perfect matchup for Hirotaka. Then we got the polar opposites, Hana-chan and Gintoki- I mean Bakaku- I mean Kabakura. Both were the most loveable lovebirds and sworn enemies, which was a sharp contrast to Hirotaka and Narumi and offered an excellent balance to the aforementioned pair. Though MAL marked them as Supporting Characters they're very much main characters as well since they're a main focus of the anime too! And that's not to mention the other supporting cast too, they're cute too and the biggest part is that even though they're a supporting cast, the brief moments they feature in were all relatable and enjoyable in their own regard and this was me trying my hardest to describe how lovable the cast is, I can't find the words to describe what I feel to the exact point but this should serve as a somewhat great substitute.STILL NOT CONVINCED? Then I can bring up the last of my cards, the artstyle. Many scorned and scoffed at the name of the studio when they first saw it's synopsis since it was made by A-1 Pictures. A studio that is designed for freelancers. What many realised later was that fortunately this was one of those “once in a blue baboon” situations where they turned out to be good, and I'm talking from the perspective of people who don't like A-1 but are objective critics. Me? Well, much like the other fans, I just enjoyed this. I have liked A-1’s many other works before in particular the Working! series and this just adds on to the fun.Coming back to the topic, it's artstyle was unique, vibrant, cheerful and not to mention adorable. There was just that some thing about it that made it such a joy to look at, whether you're watching it in 1080p, 720p, a CR free subscriber, or the 144p master race (is the show even available in this resolution? Maybe in YouTube). Needless to say it's artstyle is YET another plus point the anime had.It's very very tough to find negatives in this anime and the ones I found were that perhaps it's comedy didn't hit me every single time, though it did usually, I perhaps laughed at least once every episode and just longed for the next week’s episode to come out already and when it did, oh the joy I had.Overall, I don't think I need to point this out, but Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii is a romance anime that you definitely must watch if you're a fan of the genre or are looking for that fun Slice of Life anime to entertain and cosy up to. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this is my pick for Anime of the Year or to the extreme minimum, Romance/SoL of the Year. Romance? Yes. Otaku stuff? Yes, but that isn't too deep for someone to get bored with. End product? Something great that anyone and everyone can watch and enjoy! Yes. Even normies :PYou and I might not see eye to eye on the anime, but I'm sure you'll leave the anime with a smile, that is, if you love watching fun shows. Much like with everyone, you'll definitely find out that you struck a chord with a lot of the things in the anime. I mean, we're all Otakus aren't we?P.S: That last episode man. Incorporated everything that was great in the previous episodes and brought out the best from them to make for a fantastic end to a fantastic anime. If I were to describe Wotakoi in one word, it would ironically be that it's inclusive despite it's otaku centered focus. Hirotaka GO!"
"I’m honestly enjoying this anime so much, I look forward to the next episode every week.‘Love is hard for otaku’ to me, is a simple, funny and cute series with some references here and there, displaying the struggles and benefits of relationships between otaku, whether it’s just a friendly relationship or something more.The main characters all have their own characteristics and interests and lets be real, Hirotaka is hella cute I am shaking. Anyways! The relationships between the mc’s are developing as they get to know each other more and more and I am truly enjoying that journey, especially the little fights between Hanako and...Tarou.If you’re looking for something laid back yet cute and funny (and at times relatable), then I’d really recommend watching this. This is definitely my favourite out of the new anime airing this season.ps: I rated this with a 10 because I mainly rate anime based on how much I enjoy watching it so there's that!"
"I'm surprised there aren't more people disappointed by this show. And while I am in no way someone who thinks that a faithful adaptation is required to make a good show (see: maid dragon), I think this anime really misses the mark.Starting with the basics, the animation is distractingly bad. This show definitely probably wouldn't require the large animation budget a lot of other shows need (except possibly some of the in game shots later), they definitely cut it back to the bare minimum: lots of still reaction shots, background art that seems disconnected from the foreground characters, and oh my god the faces....The faces seem like they were outsourced to a country where people's eyes wander around their face more than the plot in a bad fanfic.Jokes aside, the story and characters are where this anime loses any hope of redemption. The manga isn't funny or sweet purely through the ""nerd-culture"" content of its jokes, but because the character interaction and great pacing make you feel connected to it. This is a story about people looking to be accepted and wanting to belong, and reading the manga provides a unique feeling of belonging along with them. In stark contrast, this anime feels amazingly routine: uninspired direction causes the character interactions and jokes to fall flat and overall the immersion is totally lost.I cannot enumerate my disappointment in this show; I was really looking forward to it. There's so much missed opportunity for something amazing, but in the end, this story feels like just one out of a thousand generic anime romcoms. If you're looking for something like this show, Net-juu no Susume's anime walks all over this."
"Who had enough of looking for a fulfilling romance in anime? Who got tired of the school-setting romance with dense characters that don't acknowledge their feelings until the last minute of the anime and they don't even hug or share a kiss? I don't know about you, but I have had enough!I tried a lot of romance anime in search of one that has the characters confess in the beginning and then the remaining of the series is them developing their relationship. But I was always disappointed. That is until I came across Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii.In the beginning, I tried watching the first...episode just to reconcile my hopeless relationship with romance animes. I went in with low expectations but that first episode threw me off guard!A confession in the first episode! I hope I wasn't dreaming! I replayed those two minutes until I believed my eyes, and my heart felt, for the first time in a very long while, full.I grew accustomed to getting disappointed in things that start off too good, so I went to the second episode reluctantly. It just got better.The anime revolves around two relationships. We get glances at how two 'otaku' couples live their everyday life at work, how they get through their days, how they support each other, and most importantly, we see glances of their love for each other and it's the cutest thing I have witnessed in a while. It has got a light-hearted comedy to complement everything and it works so well with the setting.This is a very wholesome anime. It doesn't have the forced drama, the unnecessary love triangle, the frustrating misunderstandings that could have been solved with talking, the teen angst. It is a pure romance comedy to lighten your mood and make you feel good after a shitty day. It is a win to the romance genre."
"Are u sick of all those high school setting romance show? Did u just finish ur job feeling tired trying to find some refreshment? Look no further as Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi) has got u covered. This is a very laid back show, if youre already have enough of the action shows this season provides with us, heres one that ill highly recommend for anyone who is up for their time.Wotakoi is a very well done rom-com series set in modern day Japan, covering our fellow otaku MCs, and otaku side characters. As aforementioned, our MCs are otakus, they like anime,...just like we all do. The story starts of with our female MC, Momose getting (almost) late for her new job, whilst being scared that her identity as an otaku will be found out by her new coworker. While being shown around the new environment of the office, she found herself coincidentally bumping into her old friend, Hirotaka, our male MC. At first the characters might turn u off as they seem very dull, but youll soon realize that they are just normal, very normal to a point that its like real life, a slice of life indeed. Its fun to watch as the characters start unveiling their little bits in life, how the progressed through their 'hardships' and stuff, the show is very engaging, and occasionally throwing references here and there, which ultimately leads into a far more enjoyable experience.Artstyle of Wotakoi is not impressive, but still very clean, polished, its smooth for ur eyes, I doubt anyone will complain about how it looks. I mean, as bad as how sometimes A-1 screw themselves over very badly, this here isnt the case. OST wise, the OP and ED is something ill never skip, they are just too good for not listening/watching. The songs are very good, but mostly the animation in the OP, absolutely fantastic. Its one of those very creative OPs youll ever bump into every now and then, like how the characters rotate with the camera angles, those transitions are just seamless, cocaine for ur eyes. Soundtracks in the anime itself thou doesnt have much of an impression left in me, either I was paying enough attention because of how well the anime is, or they were just there to compliment the show, nothing that memorable, but nothing to complain as well. Overall a very good and clean presentation.Now before I conclude, I rate the shows I watch MOSTLY by enjoyment. If a show is enjoyable, ill give it 8 and above, and thats probably why u might see that I have quite a high mean score for the animes Ive rated. As a 10/10 that Ive given, this is one of the shows that I think will undoubtedly be enjoyable for all, a very simple story, very likable characters and catchy OP/ED, all adds up to a great show overall. This is one of the shows that ill anticipate for every week, like how when youre 6 and eagerly waiting for the ice cream truck to come by every weekend. Even if rom-com isnt your taste, by all means give it a try, maybe youll poke into a region youve never experienced before too."
"Looking for a true romance, one with suspense, fluff, and drama? Then I will make this incredibly clear that this anime is not for you! I feel like I have to make this clear because I went into this anime based on description, genre, and rating expecting a romance and it really did not deliver.It has a lot of good qualities however. Anime and game lovers will find themselves identifying with the characters, and you’ll find yourself laughing at the exaggerated, but still relatable content. The art is also really cute, all the characters are distinct and different despite all being categorized as otaku’s....You get a peek into the lives of otaku’s of all different types, cosplay, crossplay, manga, videogames, anime, bl, etc. The main fandoms are all represented at least briefly. In its purest form, this anime is just about balancing otaku life with work life, that’s it.Still don’t believe me this isn’t a romance? Then I will spoil (but not really) the romance involved in this anime. For starters, the couple gets together by the end of episode one and it’s treated more like a joke. There is only one kiss scene the entire anime and all it is, is a peck (and it’s not even at the end of the series that this happens, so yea...no kiss at the end either) and again, it’s treated more like a joke. There’s really no development shown in the relationship, no misunderstands, or ups and downs. It’s more like two coworkers who share similar interests that happen to be a couple.I will confess that my score may be on the lower end than what this anime deserves. It’s actually a pretty good light-hearted, comedy. The art is cute, the characters are distinct and fun, and I admittedly got some laughs out of it, but I didn’t get what I wanted out of it and thus ended up rather disappointed."
"Part of becoming an adult is finding hobbies that enrich our life and fill the time after exhausting days at work. Wotaku centers around 4 main characters who are obssessed with hobbies society frowns upon, some of whom have little to no social skills at all. Momose, the main lead, is obssessed with manga, especially Yaoi, something she's had to hide from all her previous boyfriends and friends. The other 3 aren't much different: Hanako is also into yaoi and cosplay, her boyfriend Kabakura obssesses over yuri and gaming, and Nifuji games almost to the expense of all else. Momose and Nifuji are childhood friends,...and he comes to an idea: they won't have to hide they're both otakus if they date.The art and character models are stock standard for modern anime, and the soundtrack is sufficient but nothing special. There's promise in a story of adult couples who pursue their own hobbies, finding their own group that values what they do. Let's ignore Momose and Hanako's love of fetishized yaoi, or Kabukara's hyper-infantilized yuri, which is opening a can of worms. The major flaw is the characters are engaging as soggy noodles in a watered down broth. The female leads have their boy's love extend into their real life partners, getting excited by any close interactions between the two. They debate in a single scene which one is the top and which is the bottom. The character dynamics revolve around their eccentric hobbies, but we never get more than a superficial glance at those hobbies.But the biggest flaw is the characters seem to not care for each other. Nifuji and Momose's relationship never extends past childhood friends, even after they start dating. She's not particularly attracted to him, and he makes it clear he'd be into a girl with larger breasts. Their relationship and interactions barely progress or regress. It feels like one of convenience and never develops from that. We never really dive into their actual interests, besides passing references and some stock standard online gameplay.Hanako and Kabukara constantly fight when others are around, even if their interactions are much more lukewarm when they're alone together. Hanako's hobbies are probably the most engaging: she's a well-known cosplayer, and diving into the process she designs and creates the costumes could be an excellent story. At least they seem to care for each other, and spend some enjoyable moments together.The entire character dynamic is ""are the straights ok"" the anime. With a stronger cast, a deeper dive into their interests, or a stronger plot, Wotaku could be engaging with an adult cast so desperately needed in romance anime. Instead, we get something that anyone but a hardcore otaku could really enjoy. Wotaku pales in comparison to other stories revolving around otaku like ""Princess Jellyfish"". The dive into online gaming is superficial unlike ""Recovery of an MMO Junkie"". The obsession with yaoi never extends to what we see in ""Kiss Him, Not Me"". It's not particularly bad but it's uninspired at best."
"What makes a good romcom anime?CharactersComedyNarrativeRelationships...DramaRomanceTheses are the things that usually make a romcom anime better not always good though. In the Spring 18 anime season there were two romcom that were strangely competing with each other. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku. Both of these show uses all of these elements that I just listed to make theses respective shows better but yet only one of them was good though.3D Kanojo Real Girl is a badly written romcom where only it had characters would talk over with each other without letting the other person finish but at various times the show hardly feels like a romcom as the show feels like more like a shitty slice of life anime set in high school. Not to mention the portrayal of Otaku culture as well the characterization and relationships were handled very poorly to a point where point where you just want to headbang a table.Thankfully its competitor WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku did not suffer from any of the problems that caused 3D Kanojo Real Girl to become such a horrendous romcom anime and as a result WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku became the best romcom of 2018. Not the best anime of 2018 but still a pretty great one.So what made this romcom so great you may ask?You gonna to find out soon enough.Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku and with that said and done let's get started.Story.The story follows a female officer worker Narumi who secretly hides her Fujoshi lifestyle from her co-workers. One day at work she is reunited with her gaming geek childhood Hirotaka after discovering that they work at the same company. After some drinking sessions outside of work they start to date each other but will it end up being a perfect relationship for theses two or will they fall apart.I really liked the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.For starters the show does a great at establishing its characters right from the first episode.  Unlike 3D Kanojo Real Girl where that show establishes the two main characters in a contrived and silly way Wotakoi decides to establish its main cast in a more mature where in the very first scene of the show where Narumi begins chatting kindly to Hirotaka. Unlike 3D Kanojo where by now both leads would talk over each other and random crap we actually to hear Narumi inner thoughts were we find out this is all a front to keep her secret from being exposed. Hirotaka end ups only partially revealing her secret but it quickly hard cuts to them drinking together. Not only does the show do a great job at presenting its actions that they were both otaku's but it manages to respect the tone of the office setting. The thing that sold me in this show is how the how portrays its romance because you see in real life there’s always a time and place where you can date as the two love birds in the show actually don’t date with each other until a day of work is over. Meaning when Hirotaka and Naruni are not working they are dating.Like with any good romcom the show uses it comedy and romance elements right allowing us to really relate to every comedic and romance conversation that's goes along.The show also a great job at portraying the Otaku culture where it showcases the highs and lows being an Otaku as an adult age. Not to mention the show goes a great job with it's references to video games and anime like Monster Hunter, Mario Kart,  JoJo etcThe one thing that this show over most romcom that are coming out in recently is how the show doesn't take place at high school. Don't get me wrong I like my fair share of anime that were set in high school but in recent memory the high school setting itself was getting too abused to a point where some shows that would have been better if the shows were not in high school.  I know this doesn’t really make a romcom show but for this case it does because we get to see a romance that is in a more mature setting that it has its own rules to follow.Overall the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great.9/10Characters.The characters in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku pretty good for the most part.Our female romcom lead Narumi is a pretty good character. Despite trying to hide her Otaku interests from her workmates she’s actually a nice and passion girl who loves Otaku hobbies. However I have one sight problem with her and that she can a hypocritical at times where there was a piece of dialogue where Hirotaka asks Narumi why she hasn't tried dating someone who understands Otaku, she replies that only another Otaku would understand and Otaku are gross, so she won't do it. Am sorry but why would you deny a man who also an Otaku. If anything I thought date him because you both love the Otaku culture. Thankfully she becomes a better character later where she accepts dating with Hirotaka a man who is an Otaku but at there were times she can be bit cringe-worthy. Minus her slight cringly attitude at times I liked Narumi for the most part.Hirotaka is probably the best character in the series. Unlike Narumi he doesn’t even bother hiding that being a Otaku as he is seen doing Otaku things in the open and he’s not a shamed of it.The character chemistry for Narumi and Hirotaka is nothing but brilliant as they talk they time to understand each by doing all of these Otaku act’s outside of work life.Hanako and Tarou are two characters that I liked. Unlike Hirotaka and Narumi they relationship is a rocky one as they constantly like having a go with each other like enemies most of the time. While they are not as memorable as the main two couple I thought they were still enjoyable characters.Overall the characters were pretty good and enjoyable.8/10Visuals.For a romcom anime this shows looks great. A1 Pictures did a awesome at capturing the setting of the series with it's nice use of business colour pallets that blends in well the shows great character and appealing designs. This is by far the best looking anime I have seen from A1 Pictures and it's not even a shounen series while most of those shows would have decent to average visuals at best. Honestly if A1 Pictures had more anime in this style for they action series then those shows would have been least Bones/J.C Staff tier instead of looking at they just came out from McDonalds unfinished filled with art failures.The animation is pretty nice and smooth for what it is so that’s that.8/10Sound.The soundtrack in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great overall as it does a great at capturing the tone and setting of the series.Both the opening and ending themes of the show are very good and memorable.The voice acting is top notch overall. All the Seyiuss did a great job with the roles that were given.9/10Final Thoughts.Overall this show was just great romcom to start to finish.The story was great, the romance was excellent, and comedy was great and well executed. The characters are great where they all likeable in they own ways. The visuals were surprisingly great and appealing and the soundtrack was beautiful.Despite being only 11 episodes this show was still able to be a better and well thought out romcom anime then the likes of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san and 3D Kanojo Real Girl. It may not be my favourite romcom series ever but I was still one hell of a good one.If you’re looking for a great romcom anime that explores the Otaku culture in a realistic way that I recommend WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.Final Score 8.5/10"
"Wotakoi is a romance between young adults. Gamer guy who wears glasses and yaoi fangirl who acts like a tomboy. Apparently they aren't very confident about their own hobbies so naturally they go and announce their otaku lifestyle in a manner similar to ""yes, I am a vegan"" meme. Pretty cool.There are few things I quite like. Wotakoi has very direct dialogue, People say what they think and don't hide inside their shells. These characters are honest and don't spend 15 episodes pondering over how to convey. The comedy -especially after the first 2 episodes- is genius. The series is full of gamer memes...that feel very accurate to 90's kids (which our main characters also are). Episode 3 is a perfect example of rom-com done right.The main characters don't feel very special nor memorable. They are just normal, realistic folks who are doing the slice of life thingy. Arguably very smart choice when considering the nature of this series. Still, I found myself getting attached to them in just 2 episodes, and am already looking forward to seeing where their relationship will head. The actual romance between them is super cute and innocent. The overall execution makes Wotakoi seem like a feel-good series.At first, the side characters seem pretty dull, and come off quite comedic, but soon turns out they are pretty much the same as our main pair, just not in the lead role in this series. This is something to which I typically pay a lot attention, but this time our side characters are actually real characters and not filler people. I can appreciate that.The art and animation are rather typical. Nothing note-worthy in terms of good or bad. It has chosen the safe route, which is fine. The seiyuus consist of some big names, but none which voice I have yet grown tired of hearing, so I have no problems with that. When it comes to the OST, I have been too busy giggling at the cute romance scenes so I completely did not pay attention to any of the songs or if there even were any present. I only recall the video game BGM from episode 1. The series made a good job on making me forget that I was watching an anime. This is pretty much the perfect prove -for myself at least- that it is a decent show."
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (or simply Wotakoi), have two genres. Comedy and romance. That's it. Romcoms nowadays in the anime community has been popular in the late 2010's sparking a big genre called ''School''.Yet Im not talking about the ''School'' genre here. Im talking about how Wotakoi done an excellent job on progressing and making unique attempts on a Romantic-comedy segment that is surprisingly not taking place in a high school. Instead it follows the workplace of four unique characters. Unique as in every single one of this four have unique attributes that you can say ''How in the world does this four have...a partner with their attitudes?''.The story revolves mainly on the four characters of the show. Inspite of that, each episode offers uniqueness and heart-warming scenes that can make either audience feel comfortable or laugh at. It mainly focus on the lives of Nifuji Hirotaka (the quiet, not that sociable gamer), Momose Narumi (the cute, sparkling otaku and yaoi fan), Kabakura Tarou (the guy you always meet in the bar who looks like a thug but has a genuine heart) and Koyanagi Hanako (the cosplaying-loving woman and the only one who can stand-up against Kabakura.) Each episodes offers rare shots from a Rom-com like any other. Instead of doing classwork, they do office work. They are not students. They are adults. The fact that Wotakoi stands out this season is that its not like your typical high school drama like Tada-kun this season. It shows the picture of office workers and adulthood. The one thing that made this anime different to our ''in-real-life'' adulthood is that, Wotakoi still offers the taste of an otaku. Whether your a figurine collector, gamer, yaoi fan, manga fan or an anime fan, you can relate to either one or two or even every single character from these four and will make you laugh out loud. Its not only the environment is unique. The love story of this four as well. The fact that each character, have different taste, interest and attitude made them understand each other is truly inspiring. That is what you call friendship. Real friendship and that exist on the adulthood. I'm not against to the current status of Rom-coms on anime being on a high school environment. I mean some are good. Some are average. Although one thing is certain.. is that Wotakoi can upgrade the romantic-comedy segment into a whole new level.Every anime comes down into judging it by art, and Wotakoi, in all honesty, made it average on my opinion. Average although watchable. You don't need a very good animation for a romantic-comedy and all. This is not action. Although I would love to note that the animation used in the gaming episode and the opening is excellent.Speaking of the opening, this is one of those openings I added to my anime playlists because its just too good. Along with the animation and the dance (hands) choreography on the chorus of the opening, it is a great way to start off the episode. The ending as well. With its art picturing the characters like going home from a busy day of work to sleeping, with a cheerful singing, its just fit to the theme of Wotakoi.Overall, this anime when I first saw it on the PV or trailer, I was expecting it to be a good take for romance and comedy genre and I was not disappointed going through the 11 episodes. Wotakoi is good uptake of the genre and I rated it this high because of its story, mixing it with well-developed characters, fine animation, heart-warming openings and endings, and a good comedic material."
"I really don't understand how this anime gets this much praise, therefore i make it short and quick: One of the most boring animes i've ever watched and had to sit through (it was painful).>The idea had a lot of potential, but was very badly implemented.>The story and the characters are mega boring and the romance was non existent.>The art was pretty average and underwhelming.>The comedic approach wasn't well-conceived.I really wanted to like this anime, but was hugely disappointed. Can't recommend it at all...Save your precious time and don't watch it. How this anime could get a nearly 8 score is...beyond me."
"Wotaku ni koi muzukashii (or Wotakoi for short) is a really nice and cute anime.Now I have seen some comments saying that this anime has no plot and is just the daily lives of some otaku people. Have you not heard of Slice of Life? This is very much a slice of life, it has little to no plot but is just stuff that happens nearly on the daily. It is nice.The comedy also nicely hits, usually, if an anime is boring I find myself skipping a lot, but this anime I do not skip times so that is good.The story is about these...4 people, and they are otakus (nerds). One of them like Yaoi, one is a cosplayer, one loves video games, one loves collecting idols, etc. There are 2 couples in those people, and they are very open about their nerdiness in front of each other. It is very wholesome.This anime appeases the otaku fandom and romanticizes them in my opinion. Sure nothing wrong with loving a hobby, but being that engrossed in something to the point where it affects your relationship is wild and is romanticized here.The music is nice.OP is really really good, music is nice and all but OP animation is amazing.Animation quality is also really good. I liked it.Overall really nice show!8/10 still not really life-changing as I would give 9 or 10/10's. It is a nice comedic SoL anime.Thanks!-CyanCheetah"
"I have absolutely, ZERO clue how this has managed to pull a borderline 8 stars on MAL.  Just because the setting does not reside in a high school doesn't mean it is better than the ones that are.I want to write this quick review to make sure you don't waste your time with this one.The story is horrendously stale and the characters go nowhere. I'm not kidding when I say this and please take my word for it, I legitimately almost fell asleep like 3 or 4 times while watching this anime. That is how boring it was.Simply put, don't watch it....There are far better romance anime out there."
"This anime is simply put a fine piece of soul-soothing.This is no CGDCT and for that I'm honestly thankful, being able to create relatable situations and hilarious jokes and references to otaku culture.The emphasis it puts on corporal environment, the overall anxiety of fitting in and the enjoyment of our hobbies it's simply amazing and present in every episode so far without outshining the romance of our characters which I absolutely adore.Every character has their unique traits and the amazing choice of voice actors helps them in that regard giving that punchline neccesary to make the humor of the series get to you.It's a...great anime to watch when you arrive from work so give it try."
"I hate long reviews myself, so I'm gonna make it short. Full disclaimer, I dropped it after watching 6 episodes.MC - Main CharacterFMC - Female Main CharacterThis is not a romance anime even though it has the romance tag. The pathetic amount of romance it has is pretty one-sided and goes nowhere.Someone needs to tell these mangakas that there needs to be progress and not at a turtle speed. I mean, the premise was good, but I was expecting the main couple to start developing feelings for one another over time but that never happened.By the 6 episode, it was clear to me that the...MC liked the FMC but there was no sign of romantic interest from the FMC side. Hell, she treated other male characters better than she did the MC, and on top of that, it was pretty clear that the MC wasn't even her type, meaning she was not attracted to him, which is fine by me but ONLY if it slowly starts to change. Sadly, as I said, it did not.Overall: I was pretty disappointed because I did not get what I wanted from the show. One-sided love is not fun to watch especially if it does not develop into something more. A rom-com that has VERY little romance.Recommendation: Skip it. There are far better rom-coms out there such as Kamisama Hajimemashita."
"I'm wondering what's happening with slice of life shows lately.It's as if anime producers had a secret consensus, and on it they decided they'll sneak in non-existent plot into shows, and focus on making money with as little effort as possible. News flash: just because a show has slice of life genre in it, it doesn't allow it to be boring to the point of being a comatose-inducing drug.I can give you endless examples of other shows being super interesting regardless of main theme simply tracking a character or characters' lives or other barely existing plot examples. Wotakoi went off rails with plot less than...mid-way through, and decided to show filler episodes instead.Now, I haven't read the manga and perhaps it's different in it, but it doesn't excuse the poor, or rather, a complete lack of pacing and direction, resulting in my lack of engagement.Slightly annoying factor is that the shows such as this one somehow get a pass by an average person's critique and are now considered quality shows, when they are not. I get that by making the setting as uncomplicated as possible, you know, just a regular present day, no supernatural circumstances, or no deep psychological battle mysteries like known to all Death Note, no melodrama or different harem routes, none of that shit, it's guaranteed to avoid pretty much any illogical executions, events, inconsistencies or plot holes, like many action series suffer from for example, but there's no excuse for having a lack of guidance altogether and just call it quits.Atmosphere is lovely, characters are sympathetic, it's bundled in nice, shiny wrappings, the overall presentation is great, yet it ultimately fails to deliver any conclusion, it's too tedious and lacks life. I'm sorry but this will not go unnoticed by some people, myself included.I don't hate this show by a long shot, but I don't know how and/or why do these types of shows always leave a bad taste in my mouth."
"TL;DR It's a 7/10 show that is not meant for everyone. If romcoms are not your genre or want a romance that heavily focuses on development like Tsuki ga Kirei, then I wouldn't recommend it. The humor is good. The Opening is probably the best this season. However, I don't think the 3 episode rule applies here, if you don't like Romantic-Comedies.Wotakoi is a romantic-comedy that steps into the light of adulthood, and basks in the glory of being an Otaku? I'm just kidding. Being an otaku in society is still seen as a overall negative from all the weird things like Hentai and Cosplay...making people seem deranged for dressing as weird fantasy characters...BUT THAT'S GETTING OFF TOPIC. Anyways, Wotakoi is a light-hearted anime that really brings out what makes the romcom scene enjoyable. The character dynamics between all three of the couples: Narumi x Hirotaka ; Kabakura x Koyanagi ; Naoya x Kou, add a level of chemistry and flavor that never steps into disturbing or overbearing with its amount of fluff.Those who are expecting a fully-developed story with lots of romantic progression or character development are going to be sadly disappointed though. Neither of those elements get pushed forward. But, that isn't mean they aren't nurtured. Throughout the entire 11 episodes, the emotions and affection that we see nurtured throughout the entire series, while small, are noticeably different from episode 1 to the ending.Is this a show that everyone should watch? No. I don't think everyone is going to enjoy Wotakoi. It's an anime that feels like it was produced and developed for people like myself who grew up with Romantic-Comedies, and understand that speed is an aspect that rarely happens within these shows."
"Ok, so I tried so hard to like this show, I did. I fell in love with megane, (the show is so dreadful I only remember two people's names and they are side characters) at first but then he became so dull as a person, and not because of the cold-monotone personality they were trying to go for. He just was.Pink Hair chick, Momose (I had to open the info tab to get their names), is annoying, loud, and on more than one occasion admits she isn't attracted to her boyfriend. Now they go over this in the show where it could be a relationship...of convenience, (yes, yes it is), but it doesn't get resolved. These two have known each other since childhood, yet this moron doesn't know enough about him to be considered an acquaintance. I had to watch this more than once in case I missed things, sadly, I didn't.Now Gingertoki (Kabakura) and Green Haired chick (Hanako) are like the worst example of a couple. Now, everyone has arguments here and there, especially when both people are stubborn, but f***ing dammit. Him calling her a hag is not cute. Her forcing him to do things isn't cute. They get into a fight and it doesn't even get resolved and it pisses me off. It's unhealthy this type of arguing. They only gave them a couple of good eps and even then it didn't last. Like before it became 100% established that they were dating they were better with each other, then it's made clear and they're at each other's throats just for breathing weird. There is so much they have to work on for a couple that's been together for a decade.It was hard for me to believe that Hirotaka ever had a thing for this dumb chick since childhood. Like it all seemed forced.For all those people that loved it for not being the high school show where it takes ages for the couple to admit their feelings, you have been tricked with this show. These two dated because ""why not we're both otakus"" (worst reason), and throughout the show they couldn't admit their feelings. He didn't tell her how long he liked her for, she was still uncertain of the whole relationship the whole damn time, she was still not attracted to him until he removed his glasses and other chicks wanted him. Saying she hadn't seen him like that. Honestly, I can barely see them as friends. It's not that they're going slow, there is no fucking chemistry, hell there was more chemistry with Momose  (I did it, I remembered a name without having to look back) and Naoya. This whole show was Momose wondering if she loved Megane. They are literally acting like those kids that think they should date because they have things in common, but they really shouldn't because they just don't mesh well. So it is another high school show where the lead couple won't admit their feelings or act on them. It's just been dressed up differently.Now the one thing that wasn't resolved and I fear it will be for  season 2 that this show doesn't deserve, is the relationship with Naoya and Kou. Now those two were believable as a potential couple. It's like the writers spent more time making those two likable. Those seriously are the only ones I'm rooting for and even like. If there is a season 2, I won't watch it,  but at least resolve something.I give Garbagetaku a 2/10 only bc I love Naoya and Kou."
"Growing up from a kid to adulthood, I’m sure all of us has our own favorite hobbies, interests, or dirty little secret. Not many people like to admit it but it’s part of our society and how we live in. For a show about the otaku culture and exploring the lifestyle of the nerd norm, Wotake ni Koi wa Muzukashii really set the bar high. Welcome to a world where office romance, otakuism, and gaming culture become an experience you won’t forget.The English translation title is “It’s Difficult to Love an Otaku” and “Love is Hard of Otaku”. Literally, those words mushed up together already...feels like the show is a big joke or satire. While the show seems like it’s taking a risk at mixing a variety of questionable gimmicks together, I can say safely that there’s no need to worry. As a fan of the manga, I was thrilled to learn that Noitamina was chosen to air this show. It seems fitting for such an anime based on their history of lineups. What’s more is that this show also portrays a more realistic slice of life story that you don’t see too often these days. To me, this was a God-sent gift for Spring 2018.I’m not going to lie. Watching this anime reminds me of being a kid despite the show being targeted at an older audience. The goofy style of the storytelling along with the colorful character cast brings in a very playful atmosphere. Even as the show takes place in an office life environment, it’s hard to ignore the character chemistry between the main cast. From the start, we got two childhood friends named Narumi Momose and Hirotaka Nifuji. The two have known each other for awhile but are almost like complete polar opposites. Narumi is a bubbly outgoing girl with an interest in fujoshi and otome games. On the other hand, Nifuji is an otaku with an avid interest in video games and doesn’t actually seem to care what other thinks of him. Despite their different personalities, it’s undeniable that the two has chemistry both during and off work. The other two lovebirds in the show consists of Hanako Koanagi and Tarou Kabakura. They are dating as a couple and while the two constantly bickers at every chance they get, the two genuinely seems to love each other. Now, you’re probably thinking…is this going to be a show filled with drama and misunderstandings? Absolutely not. While the show contains office romance, it’s hardly a story that focuses on that exclusively. Instead, this anime stands out as a way of exploring the everyday adventures of these characters.One of the primary factors that makes this show appealing is the small character cast. It capitalizes on giving every character a chance to shine without leaving another in the dust. The couple pair of Narumi and Nifuji is infectiously entertaining to watch. Their character chemistry is shown through their interests that somehow intersects with their daily lives. At the office, the two maintains a professional relationship although they still act casually towards each other. The show explores their relationship development as they understand each other more in their adult lives. This even includes going on dates to the movies or amusement park. While the show adapts their relationship more as a ship tease, I think it’s safe that fans accepts them as a couple. Hanako and Tarou are dating already so the show doesn’t hide the fact that they care for each other. It’s mostly lighthearted romance that relies more on realism to do the storytelling. Office romance isn’t easy to adapt but this anime does that without ever being distracting. Characters act the way humans do while drawing connection to their otaku interests. Each of the main characters has their own interest. (otome games, gamer, cosplaying, bishoujo) As a central theme of the show, it establishes their interest through dialogues, interactions, and references. The show often throws in jokes with characters’ small talk and arguing to sell its comedy. It’s damn entertaining as every character gets their moment of fame. It masterfully matches the pacing of the dialogues that feels very real. The impression those moments bring is an accurate depiction of how co-workers behave. Whenever this nerdy group goes out for a drink, they act like casual adults enjoying life. It brings in the sensation of a rom-com between working adults that leaves me satisfied. Oh and before I forget to mention, give the manga a try too. The anime actually expands on some background content but the manga also feels like its own little world.To be honest, A-1 Pictures is the last studio I would imagine adapting this show. However, the production quality itself is vibrant with colorful character designs. The characters looks distinct between one another with their different hair colors and facial expressions. Character reactions also sell a good deal of the comedy especially whenever Narumi reacts in exaggerated manners. As an anime that focuses on otaku, do expect video game references to be made such as the Nintendo Switch and Monster Hunter. There’s even one episode where the characters are adapted into an RPG setting with very gimmicky video game themes.No fan service? No problem. You have the character dialogues doing the talking and most of it delivers humor in the most harmless ways. Yet at the same time, it’s able to create quality entertainment thanks to the talents of the voice cast. Narumi and Hanako in particular are able to bring out the best out of characters through that with their human personalities. The theme songs are also quite creative with their choreography. Namely, the OP song “Fiction” by Sumika is adorably cute with the body language. Every character in the theme songs stands out with their coordinated movements.With 11 episodes, it felt just enough for this anime to do what it’s intended and that’s to sell its ideas to the audience. It succeeds that thanks to its creative circle of characters and their interests. Otakuism is not something that’s accepted easily as a positive culture norm. In fact, it’s often looked down upon in our society. However, this show presented that in a positive way. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that the show is recommendable to just about anyone. A show like this deserves more attention, seriously."
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi for short) is a romance comedy which characters are Otakus (Anime or Game Otakus). It is set in an office setting, featuring 4 main characters (2 couples) that are dating each other. Here in there, you would see direct references to manga, anime, games, and the likes. However, this anime fails to deliver well in both comedy and romance. I think it is important for you to treat this more as a slice of life show featuring otaku couples, as to not give any unmet expectations.The romance in this anime is more of just a setting as it is...hardly explored. It will only occasionally throw in some romantic moments. Meanwhile, the jokes in this anime are rarely funny. I feel like the biggest problem to the comedy is the awful timing. It is really slow at delivering punchlines, making it unfunny at most times. To make it worse, there are sometimes short explanations by the game-sounding-narrator, which further slows down the pace.The characters here are not really outstanding. There's no traits or moments that I feel really stand out from them. Also, even though the couples' relationships might change a little, the characters themselves hardly changes.The background music is one problem I have with this anime. Maybe it's just not my taste, but although there are some good tracks, there are a lot of weird tracks that are just slapped unto an unfitting scene (honestly, I don't think those tracks could fit anywhere).Overall, I think this anime fails to deliver a good romcom. There is only a little romance development and jokes fall flat. This is an anime for watching the daily lives of otaku couples. And that's it, since the only thing this anime got going for it is its relatability for people familiar with the otaku culture."
"I picked up Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii along with 3D Kanojo together back when the show first aired and expected both to be about the same, I gave the former an 8 and the latter a 7 originally if my memory doesn't fail me, and from then on even though both featured otaku (now it's obvious that 3D Kanojo only has one while Wotakoi has it's entire casts as the same but I picked it up together for the same reason) it became clear as day which was fresh garbage and which was the anime that made me dance. Looking at the rating I...think you know what show turned out to be the one that made me dance, yes. This is my review of Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii, ikuze!!!Let's start with some backstory. My last seasonal romance watch was in Summer of 2017, almost exactly three seasons ago, which is shocking because if you know me, I love romance and always strive to watch it in some way or the other but in terms of seasonals I felt tired and stopped focusing on the genre. To reasons obvious to romance fans I felt Spring would be the best season for a romance fan to return to the seasonal genre and found a lot of romance anime to watch, but none, absolutely none made me fall over them as much as I fell over Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii. Not because it's cute, but because it's unique, it's fun, and of course, it's got everything else going for it.I mean, look at it's competition this season (or even the last), what romance anime did we have? Tada-kun started strong but suffered with it's cliche problem shortly after, FranXX continues to be complete garbage in the romance category (and dare I say it every other category), the anime I formerly mentioned, 3D Kanojo almost immediately disappointed me with it's second episode, Grancrest had the same FranXX situation, while Beatless could be considered one slot better than the two mentioned. Leaving us with two romance anime this season that continued to be adored by me, Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii and Akkun To Kanojo. The latter was and still is an enjoyable show but being a short, it can't compare to Wotakoi in the same breath. Why? Read on!First off, it's a fantastic slice of life anime. Wotakoi is how you make a Slice of Life Romance work and I can't find any other examples that bettered it till Winter 2017 (when I first started seasonals) and overall I'm sure it'll rank up in my top 5. Yet again you ask why? Because it knows how to captivate it's watchers with warmth. This brings us to the question, why do we watch romance anime? Many would say that it's because it brings them warmth, and surprise, surprise, Wotakoi gives you that. A cute, warm and fuzzy slice of life anime you can cosy up to whether you're single or with your partner. Even though it's centered on Otakus, it's biggest feature is that there's something for everyone.Everyone will find something in the anime worth relating to and laughing at, and I'm just talking about the normies here, if you're a mild anime watcher or a hardcore one, both parties will find lots and lots to laugh at and references to gloss over with this anime. Be it a Dragon Quest reference, a Final Fantasy reference, a Saekano reference, etc etc. There's lots to list and I don't have enough time to list them all for we must move on to the next best part. The soundtrack. I don't think I need to tell you how popular the Opening is especially with it's dance and there's been countless videos on YouTube (some of which were taken down because Sony Music) showing viewers how the dance is done or how they reacted to this marvelous choreography. And that's not to mention the ED as well. Fantastic, cosy and just a joy to watch, it's an excellent example of a testament to the anime.And we've barely scratched the surface. What else makes the anime so fun? The biggest reason why? THE CHARACTERS! I haven't seen such vibrant AND relatable characters in an anime in a very long time and this was just fabulous. I mean, it makes me wanna write on every character. First off, we didn't get one pairup, we got TWO. Then the interactions, motivations, situations, all made for a really cute yet not over the top anime. It didn't overstep its bounds yet created an environment that only Wotakoi could create and excel in. This isn't a Utopia, this is real life, and the real life says Wotakoi is excellent. Speaking of real life, the wonderful staff who worked on this anime. Having renowned VAs like Sawashiro Miyuki and the legendary Sugita Tomokazu himself, this anime wasn't at all short of talent, and the others too did brilliantly. I never for once felt like the voice actors did a bad job, or that the directing or scripting was bad in any way.I might be sounding like I'm fanboying like crazy but let's just say Wotakoi IS that kind of show. It makes you warm and you're left beaming with happiness. Definitely something I'd call a feel-good show. Oh and, another reason why the anime is so amazing? It's got adults. Not high school kids as the main characters and that gives a LOT of room for different scenarios and even though our lovely cast might seem childish, in the first place, being an otaku is a throwback to childhood anyway. And second, we don't have any blushing game of random meetups and random kisses and random blushes and random etc like most high school anime (I already triggered the FranXX fanboys, don't want another group to come after me so I won't give examples now) because from the very first episode itself, everyone is dating. Yes. You read that right. They're dating from the first episode itself and they're adults and they're Otakus. Reasons enough for why it's so fantastic?Still not convinced? How about I tell you that in spite of having such a unique setup, it handles it excellently? Convinced? I sure do hope you are, because I still have more to say. I haven't even gone to the characters in detail yet! Hirotaka might seem like your dense that you see in most high school romance but NO. Do not underestimate him because he is sharp. I mean, the ending of episode 1 changed my view of him from the get go. Surprised? I was too! He continued to be brilliant like the rest of the cast. Narumi on the other hand is fortunately not a flat female character (I just love making that pun) as we see in some romance anime and much like Hirotaka, is just a joy to watch. She's cute, relatable, and is a perfect matchup for Hirotaka. Then we got the polar opposites, Hana-chan and Gintoki- I mean Bakaku- I mean Kabakura. Both were the most loveable lovebirds and sworn enemies, which was a sharp contrast to Hirotaka and Narumi and offered an excellent balance to the aforementioned pair. Though MAL marked them as Supporting Characters they're very much main characters as well since they're a main focus of the anime too! And that's not to mention the other supporting cast too, they're cute too and the biggest part is that even though they're a supporting cast, the brief moments they feature in were all relatable and enjoyable in their own regard and this was me trying my hardest to describe how lovable the cast is, I can't find the words to describe what I feel to the exact point but this should serve as a somewhat great substitute.STILL NOT CONVINCED? Then I can bring up the last of my cards, the artstyle. Many scorned and scoffed at the name of the studio when they first saw it's synopsis since it was made by A-1 Pictures. A studio that is designed for freelancers. What many realised later was that fortunately this was one of those “once in a blue baboon” situations where they turned out to be good, and I'm talking from the perspective of people who don't like A-1 but are objective critics. Me? Well, much like the other fans, I just enjoyed this. I have liked A-1’s many other works before in particular the Working! series and this just adds on to the fun.Coming back to the topic, it's artstyle was unique, vibrant, cheerful and not to mention adorable. There was just that some thing about it that made it such a joy to look at, whether you're watching it in 1080p, 720p, a CR free subscriber, or the 144p master race (is the show even available in this resolution? Maybe in YouTube). Needless to say it's artstyle is YET another plus point the anime had.It's very very tough to find negatives in this anime and the ones I found were that perhaps it's comedy didn't hit me every single time, though it did usually, I perhaps laughed at least once every episode and just longed for the next week’s episode to come out already and when it did, oh the joy I had.Overall, I don't think I need to point this out, but Wotaku ni koi wa Muzukashii is a romance anime that you definitely must watch if you're a fan of the genre or are looking for that fun Slice of Life anime to entertain and cosy up to. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this is my pick for Anime of the Year or to the extreme minimum, Romance/SoL of the Year. Romance? Yes. Otaku stuff? Yes, but that isn't too deep for someone to get bored with. End product? Something great that anyone and everyone can watch and enjoy! Yes. Even normies :PYou and I might not see eye to eye on the anime, but I'm sure you'll leave the anime with a smile, that is, if you love watching fun shows. Much like with everyone, you'll definitely find out that you struck a chord with a lot of the things in the anime. I mean, we're all Otakus aren't we?P.S: That last episode man. Incorporated everything that was great in the previous episodes and brought out the best from them to make for a fantastic end to a fantastic anime. If I were to describe Wotakoi in one word, it would ironically be that it's inclusive despite it's otaku centered focus. Hirotaka GO!"
"I’m honestly enjoying this anime so much, I look forward to the next episode every week.‘Love is hard for otaku’ to me, is a simple, funny and cute series with some references here and there, displaying the struggles and benefits of relationships between otaku, whether it’s just a friendly relationship or something more.The main characters all have their own characteristics and interests and lets be real, Hirotaka is hella cute I am shaking. Anyways! The relationships between the mc’s are developing as they get to know each other more and more and I am truly enjoying that journey, especially the little fights between Hanako and...Tarou.If you’re looking for something laid back yet cute and funny (and at times relatable), then I’d really recommend watching this. This is definitely my favourite out of the new anime airing this season.ps: I rated this with a 10 because I mainly rate anime based on how much I enjoy watching it so there's that!"
"I'm surprised there aren't more people disappointed by this show. And while I am in no way someone who thinks that a faithful adaptation is required to make a good show (see: maid dragon), I think this anime really misses the mark.Starting with the basics, the animation is distractingly bad. This show definitely probably wouldn't require the large animation budget a lot of other shows need (except possibly some of the in game shots later), they definitely cut it back to the bare minimum: lots of still reaction shots, background art that seems disconnected from the foreground characters, and oh my god the faces....The faces seem like they were outsourced to a country where people's eyes wander around their face more than the plot in a bad fanfic.Jokes aside, the story and characters are where this anime loses any hope of redemption. The manga isn't funny or sweet purely through the ""nerd-culture"" content of its jokes, but because the character interaction and great pacing make you feel connected to it. This is a story about people looking to be accepted and wanting to belong, and reading the manga provides a unique feeling of belonging along with them. In stark contrast, this anime feels amazingly routine: uninspired direction causes the character interactions and jokes to fall flat and overall the immersion is totally lost.I cannot enumerate my disappointment in this show; I was really looking forward to it. There's so much missed opportunity for something amazing, but in the end, this story feels like just one out of a thousand generic anime romcoms. If you're looking for something like this show, Net-juu no Susume's anime walks all over this."
"Who had enough of looking for a fulfilling romance in anime? Who got tired of the school-setting romance with dense characters that don't acknowledge their feelings until the last minute of the anime and they don't even hug or share a kiss? I don't know about you, but I have had enough!I tried a lot of romance anime in search of one that has the characters confess in the beginning and then the remaining of the series is them developing their relationship. But I was always disappointed. That is until I came across Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii.In the beginning, I tried watching the first...episode just to reconcile my hopeless relationship with romance animes. I went in with low expectations but that first episode threw me off guard!A confession in the first episode! I hope I wasn't dreaming! I replayed those two minutes until I believed my eyes, and my heart felt, for the first time in a very long while, full.I grew accustomed to getting disappointed in things that start off too good, so I went to the second episode reluctantly. It just got better.The anime revolves around two relationships. We get glances at how two 'otaku' couples live their everyday life at work, how they get through their days, how they support each other, and most importantly, we see glances of their love for each other and it's the cutest thing I have witnessed in a while. It has got a light-hearted comedy to complement everything and it works so well with the setting.This is a very wholesome anime. It doesn't have the forced drama, the unnecessary love triangle, the frustrating misunderstandings that could have been solved with talking, the teen angst. It is a pure romance comedy to lighten your mood and make you feel good after a shitty day. It is a win to the romance genre."
"Are u sick of all those high school setting romance show? Did u just finish ur job feeling tired trying to find some refreshment? Look no further as Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (Wotakoi) has got u covered. This is a very laid back show, if youre already have enough of the action shows this season provides with us, heres one that ill highly recommend for anyone who is up for their time.Wotakoi is a very well done rom-com series set in modern day Japan, covering our fellow otaku MCs, and otaku side characters. As aforementioned, our MCs are otakus, they like anime,...just like we all do. The story starts of with our female MC, Momose getting (almost) late for her new job, whilst being scared that her identity as an otaku will be found out by her new coworker. While being shown around the new environment of the office, she found herself coincidentally bumping into her old friend, Hirotaka, our male MC. At first the characters might turn u off as they seem very dull, but youll soon realize that they are just normal, very normal to a point that its like real life, a slice of life indeed. Its fun to watch as the characters start unveiling their little bits in life, how the progressed through their 'hardships' and stuff, the show is very engaging, and occasionally throwing references here and there, which ultimately leads into a far more enjoyable experience.Artstyle of Wotakoi is not impressive, but still very clean, polished, its smooth for ur eyes, I doubt anyone will complain about how it looks. I mean, as bad as how sometimes A-1 screw themselves over very badly, this here isnt the case. OST wise, the OP and ED is something ill never skip, they are just too good for not listening/watching. The songs are very good, but mostly the animation in the OP, absolutely fantastic. Its one of those very creative OPs youll ever bump into every now and then, like how the characters rotate with the camera angles, those transitions are just seamless, cocaine for ur eyes. Soundtracks in the anime itself thou doesnt have much of an impression left in me, either I was paying enough attention because of how well the anime is, or they were just there to compliment the show, nothing that memorable, but nothing to complain as well. Overall a very good and clean presentation.Now before I conclude, I rate the shows I watch MOSTLY by enjoyment. If a show is enjoyable, ill give it 8 and above, and thats probably why u might see that I have quite a high mean score for the animes Ive rated. As a 10/10 that Ive given, this is one of the shows that I think will undoubtedly be enjoyable for all, a very simple story, very likable characters and catchy OP/ED, all adds up to a great show overall. This is one of the shows that ill anticipate for every week, like how when youre 6 and eagerly waiting for the ice cream truck to come by every weekend. Even if rom-com isnt your taste, by all means give it a try, maybe youll poke into a region youve never experienced before too."
"Looking for a true romance, one with suspense, fluff, and drama? Then I will make this incredibly clear that this anime is not for you! I feel like I have to make this clear because I went into this anime based on description, genre, and rating expecting a romance and it really did not deliver.It has a lot of good qualities however. Anime and game lovers will find themselves identifying with the characters, and you’ll find yourself laughing at the exaggerated, but still relatable content. The art is also really cute, all the characters are distinct and different despite all being categorized as otaku’s....You get a peek into the lives of otaku’s of all different types, cosplay, crossplay, manga, videogames, anime, bl, etc. The main fandoms are all represented at least briefly. In its purest form, this anime is just about balancing otaku life with work life, that’s it.Still don’t believe me this isn’t a romance? Then I will spoil (but not really) the romance involved in this anime. For starters, the couple gets together by the end of episode one and it’s treated more like a joke. There is only one kiss scene the entire anime and all it is, is a peck (and it’s not even at the end of the series that this happens, so yea...no kiss at the end either) and again, it’s treated more like a joke. There’s really no development shown in the relationship, no misunderstands, or ups and downs. It’s more like two coworkers who share similar interests that happen to be a couple.I will confess that my score may be on the lower end than what this anime deserves. It’s actually a pretty good light-hearted, comedy. The art is cute, the characters are distinct and fun, and I admittedly got some laughs out of it, but I didn’t get what I wanted out of it and thus ended up rather disappointed."
"Part of becoming an adult is finding hobbies that enrich our life and fill the time after exhausting days at work. Wotaku centers around 4 main characters who are obssessed with hobbies society frowns upon, some of whom have little to no social skills at all. Momose, the main lead, is obssessed with manga, especially Yaoi, something she's had to hide from all her previous boyfriends and friends. The other 3 aren't much different: Hanako is also into yaoi and cosplay, her boyfriend Kabakura obssesses over yuri and gaming, and Nifuji games almost to the expense of all else. Momose and Nifuji are childhood friends,...and he comes to an idea: they won't have to hide they're both otakus if they date.The art and character models are stock standard for modern anime, and the soundtrack is sufficient but nothing special. There's promise in a story of adult couples who pursue their own hobbies, finding their own group that values what they do. Let's ignore Momose and Hanako's love of fetishized yaoi, or Kabukara's hyper-infantilized yuri, which is opening a can of worms. The major flaw is the characters are engaging as soggy noodles in a watered down broth. The female leads have their boy's love extend into their real life partners, getting excited by any close interactions between the two. They debate in a single scene which one is the top and which is the bottom. The character dynamics revolve around their eccentric hobbies, but we never get more than a superficial glance at those hobbies.But the biggest flaw is the characters seem to not care for each other. Nifuji and Momose's relationship never extends past childhood friends, even after they start dating. She's not particularly attracted to him, and he makes it clear he'd be into a girl with larger breasts. Their relationship and interactions barely progress or regress. It feels like one of convenience and never develops from that. We never really dive into their actual interests, besides passing references and some stock standard online gameplay.Hanako and Kabukara constantly fight when others are around, even if their interactions are much more lukewarm when they're alone together. Hanako's hobbies are probably the most engaging: she's a well-known cosplayer, and diving into the process she designs and creates the costumes could be an excellent story. At least they seem to care for each other, and spend some enjoyable moments together.The entire character dynamic is ""are the straights ok"" the anime. With a stronger cast, a deeper dive into their interests, or a stronger plot, Wotaku could be engaging with an adult cast so desperately needed in romance anime. Instead, we get something that anyone but a hardcore otaku could really enjoy. Wotaku pales in comparison to other stories revolving around otaku like ""Princess Jellyfish"". The dive into online gaming is superficial unlike ""Recovery of an MMO Junkie"". The obsession with yaoi never extends to what we see in ""Kiss Him, Not Me"". It's not particularly bad but it's uninspired at best."
"What makes a good romcom anime?CharactersComedyNarrativeRelationships...DramaRomanceTheses are the things that usually make a romcom anime better not always good though. In the Spring 18 anime season there were two romcom that were strangely competing with each other. 3D Kanojo Real Girl and WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku. Both of these show uses all of these elements that I just listed to make theses respective shows better but yet only one of them was good though.3D Kanojo Real Girl is a badly written romcom where only it had characters would talk over with each other without letting the other person finish but at various times the show hardly feels like a romcom as the show feels like more like a shitty slice of life anime set in high school. Not to mention the portrayal of Otaku culture as well the characterization and relationships were handled very poorly to a point where point where you just want to headbang a table.Thankfully its competitor WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku did not suffer from any of the problems that caused 3D Kanojo Real Girl to become such a horrendous romcom anime and as a result WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku became the best romcom of 2018. Not the best anime of 2018 but still a pretty great one.So what made this romcom so great you may ask?You gonna to find out soon enough.Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku and with that said and done let's get started.Story.The story follows a female officer worker Narumi who secretly hides her Fujoshi lifestyle from her co-workers. One day at work she is reunited with her gaming geek childhood Hirotaka after discovering that they work at the same company. After some drinking sessions outside of work they start to date each other but will it end up being a perfect relationship for theses two or will they fall apart.I really liked the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.For starters the show does a great at establishing its characters right from the first episode.  Unlike 3D Kanojo Real Girl where that show establishes the two main characters in a contrived and silly way Wotakoi decides to establish its main cast in a more mature where in the very first scene of the show where Narumi begins chatting kindly to Hirotaka. Unlike 3D Kanojo where by now both leads would talk over each other and random crap we actually to hear Narumi inner thoughts were we find out this is all a front to keep her secret from being exposed. Hirotaka end ups only partially revealing her secret but it quickly hard cuts to them drinking together. Not only does the show do a great job at presenting its actions that they were both otaku's but it manages to respect the tone of the office setting. The thing that sold me in this show is how the how portrays its romance because you see in real life there’s always a time and place where you can date as the two love birds in the show actually don’t date with each other until a day of work is over. Meaning when Hirotaka and Naruni are not working they are dating.Like with any good romcom the show uses it comedy and romance elements right allowing us to really relate to every comedic and romance conversation that's goes along.The show also a great job at portraying the Otaku culture where it showcases the highs and lows being an Otaku as an adult age. Not to mention the show goes a great job with it's references to video games and anime like Monster Hunter, Mario Kart,  JoJo etcThe one thing that this show over most romcom that are coming out in recently is how the show doesn't take place at high school. Don't get me wrong I like my fair share of anime that were set in high school but in recent memory the high school setting itself was getting too abused to a point where some shows that would have been better if the shows were not in high school.  I know this doesn’t really make a romcom show but for this case it does because we get to see a romance that is in a more mature setting that it has its own rules to follow.Overall the story for WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great.9/10Characters.The characters in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku pretty good for the most part.Our female romcom lead Narumi is a pretty good character. Despite trying to hide her Otaku interests from her workmates she’s actually a nice and passion girl who loves Otaku hobbies. However I have one sight problem with her and that she can a hypocritical at times where there was a piece of dialogue where Hirotaka asks Narumi why she hasn't tried dating someone who understands Otaku, she replies that only another Otaku would understand and Otaku are gross, so she won't do it. Am sorry but why would you deny a man who also an Otaku. If anything I thought date him because you both love the Otaku culture. Thankfully she becomes a better character later where she accepts dating with Hirotaka a man who is an Otaku but at there were times she can be bit cringe-worthy. Minus her slight cringly attitude at times I liked Narumi for the most part.Hirotaka is probably the best character in the series. Unlike Narumi he doesn’t even bother hiding that being a Otaku as he is seen doing Otaku things in the open and he’s not a shamed of it.The character chemistry for Narumi and Hirotaka is nothing but brilliant as they talk they time to understand each by doing all of these Otaku act’s outside of work life.Hanako and Tarou are two characters that I liked. Unlike Hirotaka and Narumi they relationship is a rocky one as they constantly like having a go with each other like enemies most of the time. While they are not as memorable as the main two couple I thought they were still enjoyable characters.Overall the characters were pretty good and enjoyable.8/10Visuals.For a romcom anime this shows looks great. A1 Pictures did a awesome at capturing the setting of the series with it's nice use of business colour pallets that blends in well the shows great character and appealing designs. This is by far the best looking anime I have seen from A1 Pictures and it's not even a shounen series while most of those shows would have decent to average visuals at best. Honestly if A1 Pictures had more anime in this style for they action series then those shows would have been least Bones/J.C Staff tier instead of looking at they just came out from McDonalds unfinished filled with art failures.The animation is pretty nice and smooth for what it is so that’s that.8/10Sound.The soundtrack in WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku was great overall as it does a great at capturing the tone and setting of the series.Both the opening and ending themes of the show are very good and memorable.The voice acting is top notch overall. All the Seyiuss did a great job with the roles that were given.9/10Final Thoughts.Overall this show was just great romcom to start to finish.The story was great, the romance was excellent, and comedy was great and well executed. The characters are great where they all likeable in they own ways. The visuals were surprisingly great and appealing and the soundtrack was beautiful.Despite being only 11 episodes this show was still able to be a better and well thought out romcom anime then the likes of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san and 3D Kanojo Real Girl. It may not be my favourite romcom series ever but I was still one hell of a good one.If you’re looking for a great romcom anime that explores the Otaku culture in a realistic way that I recommend WotaKoi Love is Hard for Otaku.Final Score 8.5/10"
"Wotakoi is a romance between young adults. Gamer guy who wears glasses and yaoi fangirl who acts like a tomboy. Apparently they aren't very confident about their own hobbies so naturally they go and announce their otaku lifestyle in a manner similar to ""yes, I am a vegan"" meme. Pretty cool.There are few things I quite like. Wotakoi has very direct dialogue, People say what they think and don't hide inside their shells. These characters are honest and don't spend 15 episodes pondering over how to convey. The comedy -especially after the first 2 episodes- is genius. The series is full of gamer memes...that feel very accurate to 90's kids (which our main characters also are). Episode 3 is a perfect example of rom-com done right.The main characters don't feel very special nor memorable. They are just normal, realistic folks who are doing the slice of life thingy. Arguably very smart choice when considering the nature of this series. Still, I found myself getting attached to them in just 2 episodes, and am already looking forward to seeing where their relationship will head. The actual romance between them is super cute and innocent. The overall execution makes Wotakoi seem like a feel-good series.At first, the side characters seem pretty dull, and come off quite comedic, but soon turns out they are pretty much the same as our main pair, just not in the lead role in this series. This is something to which I typically pay a lot attention, but this time our side characters are actually real characters and not filler people. I can appreciate that.The art and animation are rather typical. Nothing note-worthy in terms of good or bad. It has chosen the safe route, which is fine. The seiyuus consist of some big names, but none which voice I have yet grown tired of hearing, so I have no problems with that. When it comes to the OST, I have been too busy giggling at the cute romance scenes so I completely did not pay attention to any of the songs or if there even were any present. I only recall the video game BGM from episode 1. The series made a good job on making me forget that I was watching an anime. This is pretty much the perfect prove -for myself at least- that it is a decent show."
"Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii (or simply Wotakoi), have two genres. Comedy and romance. That's it. Romcoms nowadays in the anime community has been popular in the late 2010's sparking a big genre called ''School''.Yet Im not talking about the ''School'' genre here. Im talking about how Wotakoi done an excellent job on progressing and making unique attempts on a Romantic-comedy segment that is surprisingly not taking place in a high school. Instead it follows the workplace of four unique characters. Unique as in every single one of this four have unique attributes that you can say ''How in the world does this four have...a partner with their attitudes?''.The story revolves mainly on the four characters of the show. Inspite of that, each episode offers uniqueness and heart-warming scenes that can make either audience feel comfortable or laugh at. It mainly focus on the lives of Nifuji Hirotaka (the quiet, not that sociable gamer), Momose Narumi (the cute, sparkling otaku and yaoi fan), Kabakura Tarou (the guy you always meet in the bar who looks like a thug but has a genuine heart) and Koyanagi Hanako (the cosplaying-loving woman and the only one who can stand-up against Kabakura.) Each episodes offers rare shots from a Rom-com like any other. Instead of doing classwork, they do office work. They are not students. They are adults. The fact that Wotakoi stands out this season is that its not like your typical high school drama like Tada-kun this season. It shows the picture of office workers and adulthood. The one thing that made this anime different to our ''in-real-life'' adulthood is that, Wotakoi still offers the taste of an otaku. Whether your a figurine collector, gamer, yaoi fan, manga fan or an anime fan, you can relate to either one or two or even every single character from these four and will make you laugh out loud. Its not only the environment is unique. The love story of this four as well. The fact that each character, have different taste, interest and attitude made them understand each other is truly inspiring. That is what you call friendship. Real friendship and that exist on the adulthood. I'm not against to the current status of Rom-coms on anime being on a high school environment. I mean some are good. Some are average. Although one thing is certain.. is that Wotakoi can upgrade the romantic-comedy segment into a whole new level.Every anime comes down into judging it by art, and Wotakoi, in all honesty, made it average on my opinion. Average although watchable. You don't need a very good animation for a romantic-comedy and all. This is not action. Although I would love to note that the animation used in the gaming episode and the opening is excellent.Speaking of the opening, this is one of those openings I added to my anime playlists because its just too good. Along with the animation and the dance (hands) choreography on the chorus of the opening, it is a great way to start off the episode. The ending as well. With its art picturing the characters like going home from a busy day of work to sleeping, with a cheerful singing, its just fit to the theme of Wotakoi.Overall, this anime when I first saw it on the PV or trailer, I was expecting it to be a good take for romance and comedy genre and I was not disappointed going through the 11 episodes. Wotakoi is good uptake of the genre and I rated it this high because of its story, mixing it with well-developed characters, fine animation, heart-warming openings and endings, and a good comedic material."
"I really don't understand how this anime gets this much praise, therefore i make it short and quick: One of the most boring animes i've ever watched and had to sit through (it was painful).>The idea had a lot of potential, but was very badly implemented.>The story and the characters are mega boring and the romance was non existent.>The art was pretty average and underwhelming.>The comedic approach wasn't well-conceived.I really wanted to like this anime, but was hugely disappointed. Can't recommend it at all...Save your precious time and don't watch it. How this anime could get a nearly 8 score is...beyond me."
"Wotaku ni koi muzukashii (or Wotakoi for short) is a really nice and cute anime.Now I have seen some comments saying that this anime has no plot and is just the daily lives of some otaku people. Have you not heard of Slice of Life? This is very much a slice of life, it has little to no plot but is just stuff that happens nearly on the daily. It is nice.The comedy also nicely hits, usually, if an anime is boring I find myself skipping a lot, but this anime I do not skip times so that is good.The story is about these...4 people, and they are otakus (nerds). One of them like Yaoi, one is a cosplayer, one loves video games, one loves collecting idols, etc. There are 2 couples in those people, and they are very open about their nerdiness in front of each other. It is very wholesome.This anime appeases the otaku fandom and romanticizes them in my opinion. Sure nothing wrong with loving a hobby, but being that engrossed in something to the point where it affects your relationship is wild and is romanticized here.The music is nice.OP is really really good, music is nice and all but OP animation is amazing.Animation quality is also really good. I liked it.Overall really nice show!8/10 still not really life-changing as I would give 9 or 10/10's. It is a nice comedic SoL anime.Thanks!-CyanCheetah"
"I have absolutely, ZERO clue how this has managed to pull a borderline 8 stars on MAL.  Just because the setting does not reside in a high school doesn't mean it is better than the ones that are.I want to write this quick review to make sure you don't waste your time with this one.The story is horrendously stale and the characters go nowhere. I'm not kidding when I say this and please take my word for it, I legitimately almost fell asleep like 3 or 4 times while watching this anime. That is how boring it was.Simply put, don't watch it....There are far better romance anime out there."
"This anime is simply put a fine piece of soul-soothing.This is no CGDCT and for that I'm honestly thankful, being able to create relatable situations and hilarious jokes and references to otaku culture.The emphasis it puts on corporal environment, the overall anxiety of fitting in and the enjoyment of our hobbies it's simply amazing and present in every episode so far without outshining the romance of our characters which I absolutely adore.Every character has their unique traits and the amazing choice of voice actors helps them in that regard giving that punchline neccesary to make the humor of the series get to you.It's a...great anime to watch when you arrive from work so give it try."
"I hate long reviews myself, so I'm gonna make it short. Full disclaimer, I dropped it after watching 6 episodes.MC - Main CharacterFMC - Female Main CharacterThis is not a romance anime even though it has the romance tag. The pathetic amount of romance it has is pretty one-sided and goes nowhere.Someone needs to tell these mangakas that there needs to be progress and not at a turtle speed. I mean, the premise was good, but I was expecting the main couple to start developing feelings for one another over time but that never happened.By the 6 episode, it was clear to me that the...MC liked the FMC but there was no sign of romantic interest from the FMC side. Hell, she treated other male characters better than she did the MC, and on top of that, it was pretty clear that the MC wasn't even her type, meaning she was not attracted to him, which is fine by me but ONLY if it slowly starts to change. Sadly, as I said, it did not.Overall: I was pretty disappointed because I did not get what I wanted from the show. One-sided love is not fun to watch especially if it does not develop into something more. A rom-com that has VERY little romance.Recommendation: Skip it. There are far better rom-coms out there such as Kamisama Hajimemashita."
"I'm wondering what's happening with slice of life shows lately.It's as if anime producers had a secret consensus, and on it they decided they'll sneak in non-existent plot into shows, and focus on making money with as little effort as possible. News flash: just because a show has slice of life genre in it, it doesn't allow it to be boring to the point of being a comatose-inducing drug.I can give you endless examples of other shows being super interesting regardless of main theme simply tracking a character or characters' lives or other barely existing plot examples. Wotakoi went off rails with plot less than...mid-way through, and decided to show filler episodes instead.Now, I haven't read the manga and perhaps it's different in it, but it doesn't excuse the poor, or rather, a complete lack of pacing and direction, resulting in my lack of engagement.Slightly annoying factor is that the shows such as this one somehow get a pass by an average person's critique and are now considered quality shows, when they are not. I get that by making the setting as uncomplicated as possible, you know, just a regular present day, no supernatural circumstances, or no deep psychological battle mysteries like known to all Death Note, no melodrama or different harem routes, none of that shit, it's guaranteed to avoid pretty much any illogical executions, events, inconsistencies or plot holes, like many action series suffer from for example, but there's no excuse for having a lack of guidance altogether and just call it quits.Atmosphere is lovely, characters are sympathetic, it's bundled in nice, shiny wrappings, the overall presentation is great, yet it ultimately fails to deliver any conclusion, it's too tedious and lacks life. I'm sorry but this will not go unnoticed by some people, myself included.I don't hate this show by a long shot, but I don't know how and/or why do these types of shows always leave a bad taste in my mouth."
"TL;DR It's a 7/10 show that is not meant for everyone. If romcoms are not your genre or want a romance that heavily focuses on development like Tsuki ga Kirei, then I wouldn't recommend it. The humor is good. The Opening is probably the best this season. However, I don't think the 3 episode rule applies here, if you don't like Romantic-Comedies.Wotakoi is a romantic-comedy that steps into the light of adulthood, and basks in the glory of being an Otaku? I'm just kidding. Being an otaku in society is still seen as a overall negative from all the weird things like Hentai and Cosplay...making people seem deranged for dressing as weird fantasy characters...BUT THAT'S GETTING OFF TOPIC. Anyways, Wotakoi is a light-hearted anime that really brings out what makes the romcom scene enjoyable. The character dynamics between all three of the couples: Narumi x Hirotaka ; Kabakura x Koyanagi ; Naoya x Kou, add a level of chemistry and flavor that never steps into disturbing or overbearing with its amount of fluff.Those who are expecting a fully-developed story with lots of romantic progression or character development are going to be sadly disappointed though. Neither of those elements get pushed forward. But, that isn't mean they aren't nurtured. Throughout the entire 11 episodes, the emotions and affection that we see nurtured throughout the entire series, while small, are noticeably different from episode 1 to the ending.Is this a show that everyone should watch? No. I don't think everyone is going to enjoy Wotakoi. It's an anime that feels like it was produced and developed for people like myself who grew up with Romantic-Comedies, and understand that speed is an aspect that rarely happens within these shows."
"Ok, so I tried so hard to like this show, I did. I fell in love with megane, (the show is so dreadful I only remember two people's names and they are side characters) at first but then he became so dull as a person, and not because of the cold-monotone personality they were trying to go for. He just was.Pink Hair chick, Momose (I had to open the info tab to get their names), is annoying, loud, and on more than one occasion admits she isn't attracted to her boyfriend. Now they go over this in the show where it could be a relationship...of convenience, (yes, yes it is), but it doesn't get resolved. These two have known each other since childhood, yet this moron doesn't know enough about him to be considered an acquaintance. I had to watch this more than once in case I missed things, sadly, I didn't.Now Gingertoki (Kabakura) and Green Haired chick (Hanako) are like the worst example of a couple. Now, everyone has arguments here and there, especially when both people are stubborn, but f***ing dammit. Him calling her a hag is not cute. Her forcing him to do things isn't cute. They get into a fight and it doesn't even get resolved and it pisses me off. It's unhealthy this type of arguing. They only gave them a couple of good eps and even then it didn't last. Like before it became 100% established that they were dating they were better with each other, then it's made clear and they're at each other's throats just for breathing weird. There is so much they have to work on for a couple that's been together for a decade.It was hard for me to believe that Hirotaka ever had a thing for this dumb chick since childhood. Like it all seemed forced.For all those people that loved it for not being the high school show where it takes ages for the couple to admit their feelings, you have been tricked with this show. These two dated because ""why not we're both otakus"" (worst reason), and throughout the show they couldn't admit their feelings. He didn't tell her how long he liked her for, she was still uncertain of the whole relationship the whole damn time, she was still not attracted to him until he removed his glasses and other chicks wanted him. Saying she hadn't seen him like that. Honestly, I can barely see them as friends. It's not that they're going slow, there is no fucking chemistry, hell there was more chemistry with Momose  (I did it, I remembered a name without having to look back) and Naoya. This whole show was Momose wondering if she loved Megane. They are literally acting like those kids that think they should date because they have things in common, but they really shouldn't because they just don't mesh well. So it is another high school show where the lead couple won't admit their feelings or act on them. It's just been dressed up differently.Now the one thing that wasn't resolved and I fear it will be for  season 2 that this show doesn't deserve, is the relationship with Naoya and Kou. Now those two were believable as a potential couple. It's like the writers spent more time making those two likable. Those seriously are the only ones I'm rooting for and even like. If there is a season 2, I won't watch it,  but at least resolve something.I give Garbagetaku a 2/10 only bc I love Naoya and Kou."
